Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long term investments in certain non timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

0000896852-13-000004	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110.

The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid. ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of Auction Rate Securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Consent Order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. NRS 90.420(1)(H) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. NRS 90.420(1)(1) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to a Consent Order entered by the Division on August 3, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $199,478.53 to the Nevada State General Fund for credit to the Secretary of State's Operating General Fund Budget account and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The Consent Order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a Term Sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $199,478.53 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The Consent Order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the Consent Order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Consent Order, pursuant to a Consent Order entered by the Division on August 3, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $199,478.53 to the Nevada State General Fund.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Iowa Code Section 502.412(4)(M) (2009) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Iowa Code Section 502.412(4)(I) (2009) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on June 14, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $31,445.45 to the Iowa Insurance Division and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $31,445.45 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $31,445.45 to the Iowa Insurance Division and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

The Office alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent agreement and final order, DBSI consented to the Office making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.  Section 517.161 (1)(H) of the Florida statutes and Rule 69W-600.013(1)(H)(1) of the Florida Administrative Code allows the Office, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

Pursuant to the consent agreement and final order entered by the Office on February 1, 2011, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $509,165.32 to the Department of Financial Services of the State of Florida and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent agreement and final order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $509,165.32 penalty imposed by the Office is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent agreement and final order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Pursuant to the consent agree. and final 2/1/11 order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $509,165.32 to the Dept. of Fin.

0001018490-13-000004	violationOfRegulations	6	Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant, and Gary P. Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

AIM	Order No. 05 1318	30-AUG-2005	West Virginia Office of the State Auditor Securities Commission WVASC	AIM and ADI failed to disclose in the prospectuses for the AIM Funds that they had entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of such funds, thereby breaching their fiduciary duties to such funds and, as a result, violating the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. There are no allegations specifically naming or mentioning IFG or INVESCO Funds. The disposition of the proceeding. On August 30, 2005, The West Virginia Office of the State Auditor Securities Commission WVASC issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing to AIM and ADI Order No. 05 1318. The WVASC purports to make findings of fact that essentially mirror the WVAGs allegations mentioned above and conclusions of law to the effect that AIM and ADI violated the West Virginia Securities Laws. Each of the WVAG and the WVASC are represented by the same private law firm acting as a so called private state attorney general. The WVASC purports to order AIM and ADI to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an administrative assessment to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, AIMs time to respond to that Order has been indefinitely suspended.	On Aug 30, 2005, WVASC issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing to AIM a ADI. WVASC mirrors allegations mentioned above. AIMs time to respond to that Order has been indefinitely suspended.

INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

0000896852-13-000002	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.	On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.
