The Final Judgment, entered on Feb. 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.

The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $355,386.70 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

Pursuant to the stipulation and consent order entered by the Division on October 27, 2011, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $188,095.65 to the Utah Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The stipulation and consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $188,095.65 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the stipulation and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $188,095.65 to the Utah Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of Auction Rate Securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Consent Order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. 6 Del. C. section 7316(A)(7) allows the Division, through its Administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. 6 Del.

Pursuant to a Consent Order entered by the Division on November 5, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $33,075.19 to the State of Delaware and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The Consent Order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a Term Sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $33,075.19 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The Consent Order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the Consent Order.

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS') and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (i) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (ii) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (iii) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business, in violation of section 8.E(1)(b) of the Illinois Securities Act ('Act'); and (2) in connection with the failure to (i) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS; (ii) create and maintain adequate supervisory procedures concerning ARS; (iii) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents; and (iv) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct, in violation of its duties under section 8.E(1)(e)(i) of the act. The activities cited in the consent order are grounds, pursuant to the act, for the initiation of administrative proceedings, and, pursuant to the act, to impose such other remedial measures as may be necessary in the public interest. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on July 16, 2012, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $535,364.03 to the Illinois Secretary of State and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.

The term sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $535,364.03 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedures for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Dept., without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $535,364.03 and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before Feb. 13, 2008.

The NASD alleged that DBSI violated NASD conduct rule 2110 in connection with the firm's allocation and sale of initial public offerings ('IPOS') from September 1999 through March 2000.

This matter stems from the personal financial difficulties of a former DBSI client advisor in the firm's Boston branch.

DBSI terminated his employment in April 2010. In the AWC settling this matter, DBSI accepted and consented, without admitting or denying, that the firm's lexicon-based search system for the review of electronic correspondence in the PCS division was inadequate to search for terms indicating that a client advisor might be experiencing personal financial difficulties and/or violating certain applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with those difficulties, and that the firm's supervisory system and written supervisory procedures were inadequate to effectively respond to such 'red flags.'  Accordingly, as set forth more fully in the AWC, the firm has undertaken to add terms to its email review lexicon for client advisors, to review electronic communications of client advisors from January 1, 2012 to date using those additional terms, and to review its supervisory procedures for responding to 'red flags' of potential misconduct by a client advisor relating to such personal financial difficulties.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a 2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.  The fine was paid on October 5, 2015.

In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC.

The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

Accordingly, as set forth more fully in the AWC, the firm has undertaken to add terms to its email review lexicon for client advisors, to review electronic communications of client advisors from January 1, 2012 to date using those additional terms, and to review its supervisory procedures for responding to 'red flags' of potential misconduct by a client advisor relating to such personal financial difficulties.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.

FINRA alleged DBSI exceeded the relevant position limit in three different securities for five different customers (exceeding the relevant position limit in a range of between 7.9 percent and 120 percent) for between one and seven consecutive days during October 2011, January 2014, November 2014, and January 2015 through February 2015. The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report its OCEND in one symbol. The findings also stated that the Firm failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for acting in concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period after February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360(B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014).

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 11-412(A)(7) of the Maryland Securities Act  allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 11-412(A)(7) of the Maryland Securities Act allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on September 22, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $718,212.94 to the Maryland Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $718,212.94 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	NJ Bureau of Securities Action 6/3/09	03-JUN-2009	Bureau of Securities, State of New Jersey ('NJ Bureau of Securities')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter:  Initiation date 6/3/2009.  The NJ Bureau of Securities alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of Auction Rate Securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Pursuant to a consent order executed on June 3, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $1,057,350.69 to New Jersey and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  DBSI also agreed to pay $15,000 to the North American Securities Administrators Association ('NASAA') as reimbursement for costs associated with NASAA'S assistance on NJ's investigation.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'August 31 Term Sheet').  The August 31 Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $1,057,350.69 penalty imposed by New Jersey is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Bureau Chief making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business in violation of N.J.S.A 49:3-58(A)(2)(VII); and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct, in violation of its duties under N.J.S.A. 49:3-58(A)(2)(XI).	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $1,057,350.69 to New Jersey, and also agreed to pay $15,000 to the North American Securities Administrators Association.

The Assurance of Discontinuance ('AOD') entered into between DBSI and the NYAG on June 3, 2009 alleged that DBSI misled certain investors as to the risks related to, and the liquidity of, Auction Rate Securities ('ARS').  Pursuant to the AOD, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $678,282.50 to New York and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The AOD finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and the NYAG and that resulted in a Term Sheet (the 'August 31 Term Sheet').  The August 31 Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000, and the $678,282.50 penalty imposed by the NYAG is New York's pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.

The Autorite Des Marches Financiers alleged certain abuses arising out of the convertible bond offer for French telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel which took place in December 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on the basis of information communicated by DB London before the issuance of the bonds was publicly announced, during its market sounding activities.  The AMF concluded that DB had no culpability in relation to alleged insider dealing activities, but alleged procedural, record keeping omissions by DB, in relation to the records it maintained of the market soundings.  On December 22, 2006, the AMF notified DB London that it would be sanctioned for technical and procedural violations in connection with a convertible bond offering by Alcatel, DB lead managed the transaction.  There was no case to answer for insider trading. DB London conducted market soundings with several hedge funds ahead of the offering in December 2002. DB London was able to produce documentation sufficient to attest that it was engaged in market sounding which is permitted under AMF Rules. However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations. AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.	AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

In addition, the findings state that DBSI submitted inaccurate reports to the LOPR, in that the Firm entered incorrect data in the 'effective date' field due to errors involving the Firm's third-party vendor's processing of certain trades. During the same sampled period, DBSI misreported options positions to the LOPR in tens of millions of instances as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., City, Quantity, and Tax Identification fields) when reporting those positions and its failure to report acting in concert identifiers in certain instances.

The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report its OCEND in one symbol. The findings also stated that the Firm failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for acting in concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC.

Also, DBSI failed to maintain adequate supervisory systems and controls, including adequate written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to achieve the accurate reporting of reportable options positions to the LOPR. This constitutes violations of Exchange Rules 748 and 1003.

The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

0000842657-17-000002	violationOfRegulations	15	Deutsche Bank AG ('DBAG'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	SEC File No. 3-16557	26-MAY-2015	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 5/26/2015. On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a 55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions it its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through the real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a $2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting. The fine was paid on October 5, 2015.

('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Docket No. 2009-07	08-APR-2010	Bureau of Securities of Dept. of Fin. of the State of Idaho ('The Department')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter:  Initiation date 4/8/2010.  The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Idaho Code Section 30-14-412(D)(13) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Idaho Code Section 30-14-412(D)(9) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on April 8, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Idaho Department of Finance and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. NMSA Section 58-13B-16A(2)(H) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. NMSA Section 58-13B-16A(2)(K) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on March 10, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $51,862.37 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $51,862.37 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $51,862.37 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

The South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.

Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus.

Utah Code Ann. Section 61-1-6(2)(A)(II)(J) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the stipulation and consent order entered by the Division on October 27, 2011, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $188,095.65 to the Utah Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.

The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on the basis of information communicated by DB London before the issuance of the bonds was publicly announced, during its market sounding activities.  The AMF concluded that DB had no culpability in relation to alleged insider dealing activities, but alleged procedural, record keeping omissions by DB, in relation to the records it maintained of the market soundings.

DB London was able to produce documentation sufficient to attest that it was engaged in market sounding which is permitted under AMF Rules. However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations.

0001520138-17-000024	sraViolationOfRules	1	FRANK EDWARD BRICKELL	Complaint	31-MAR-2008	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) - Self Regulatory Organization	FINRA's Department of Enforcement is alleging that activities of three clients of World Trade Financial Corporation violated section 5 of the securities act and Frank Edward Brickell, as the registered representative, violated Conduct Rule 2110 by selling unregistered stock without an applicable exemption from registration. The shares deposited with the registered representative did not contain any restrictions on resale or transfer according to the transfer agent who was in possession of a legal opinion addressing the available of an exemption to registration. Enforcement has argued that the representative and the firm had a heighted responsibility to conduct a further inquiry as to the resale of these shares. The case also involves additional broker dealers, registered representatives, and shareholders who are claimed to have participated in an unregistered distribution. The shareholders and the issuer's officers appear to have knowingly orchestrated a distribution. World Trade Financial Corporation, its supervisors, and the registered representative did not knowingly participate in the alleged distribution. At the commencement of the hearing it was argued that distribution did occur, but there was lack of evidence that an illegal distribution occurred. The underlying premise is whether World Trade Financial Corporation had a heightened responsibility to conduct further inquires concerning the resale of the securities.	The decision is final.

Dept. of State of Colorado	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 1/20/2010. The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. C.R.S. section 11-51-410(1)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. C.R.S. section 11-51-410(1)(G)(I) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on January 20, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $184,843.39 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $184,843.39 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $184,843.39 to the Division of Sec. and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

LSA-R.S. 51:712A(2) allows the Commissioner to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. LSA-R.S. 51:712A allows the Commissioner to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Commissioner on June 7, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Louisiana Commissioner of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Commissioner is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Louisiana Comm. of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume.

The fine was paid on 1/2/13.

ISE alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') during a sampled period between January 2010 and March 2015, failed to report options positions to the LOPR in as many as 943,545 instances and over-reported options positions to the LOPR, in that the Firm entered incorrect data in the 'effective date' field due to errors involving the Firm's third-party vendor's processing of certain trades. During the same sampled period, DBSI misreported options positions to the LOPR in tens of millions of instances as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., City, Quantity, and Tax Identification fields) when reporting those positions and its failure to report acting in concert identifiers in certain instances. This conduct violated ISE Rule 415(A).  Also, DBSI failed to maintain adequate supervisory systems and controls, including adequate written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to achieve the accurate reporting of reportable options positions to the LOPR.

FINRA alleged DBSI exceeded the relevant position limit in three different securities for five different customers (exceeding the relevant position limit in a range of between 7.9 percent and 120 percent) for between one and seven consecutive days during October 2011, January 2014, and November 2014, and January 2015 through February 2015. The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360 (B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period of February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360 (B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014).

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.

Accordingly, as set forth more fully in the AWC, the firm has undertaken to add terms to its email review lexicon for client advisors, to review electronic communications of client advisors from January 1, 2012 to date using those additional terms, and to review its supervisory procedures for responding to 'red flags' of potential misconduct by a client advisor relating to such personal financial difficulties.
