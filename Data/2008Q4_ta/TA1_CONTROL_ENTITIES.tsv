Accounts are maintained jointly by DBTCA and STN. STN in its transfer agent function provides services to DBTCA in a manner as if STN is an independent, dedicated contractor that works solely for DBTCA and no other transfer agent. There is a shared system of database for DBTCA and STN. An example is escheatment - the details of escheatment are maintained by STN while the remission to the states is done in the name of and on behalf of DBTCA. STN management is responsible to the business line management of DBAG and DBAG affiliates/subsidiaries including DBTCA. The business line unit head in Tennessee reports to business line unit management of DBAG. Audits are performed by DBAG's Audit Department. Examinations of DBAG NY branch and subsidiary bank, DBTCA, are performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York Department of Banking.
