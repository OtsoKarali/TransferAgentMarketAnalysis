CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

0000909567-08-001112	falseStatementOrOmission	1	INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (INVESCO)	Docket #03-CV-2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds' prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long-term investments in certain non-timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds' prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors' consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding: The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured; ordered to cease and desist; and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(D) and 34(B) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D-1, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US$215 Million. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US$110 Million. Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. (formerly, A I M Advisors), as successor adviser to INVESCO Funds Group, agreed to pay the penalty and disgorgement amounts ordered against INVESCO Funds Group on the following dates: US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2004, and the remaining US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2005. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US$235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market-timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including: maintaining a board of trustees that is 75% independent; designating an independent Chairman of the Board; maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees; holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years; cooperating fully with the SEC; maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman; retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant; conducting periodic compliance reviews; and retaining an independent distribution consultant.	SEC proceeding settled Oct 8, 2004. INVESCO was censured; ordered to cease and desist; ordered to disgorge profits of $215 Million; ordered to pay civil money penalties of $110 Million; and remedial sanctions.

A I M Advisors and A I M Distributors led the AIM Fund Trustees to believe that A I M Advisors was diligently enforcing the per-year 10-exchange limit. A I M Advisors breached its fiduciary duty to AIM Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the Trustees of the AIM Funds or to the AIM Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the Trustees' Consent to the timing agreements. A I M Distributors negotiated and approved market timing agreements, and provided materially misleading information about A I M Advisors' market timing and prevention efforts to the Trustees of the AIM Funds. A I M Advisors and A I M Distributors financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, neither A I M Advisors nor A I M Distributors admitted nor denied the allegations.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) in connection with DBSI alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.

However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations.

On December 19, 2006, Deutsche Bank AG London Branch ('DB London') received notice that the Comision Nacional Del Mercado ('CNMV') received approval to sanction DB London in respect of an equity placement (block trade) executed in shares of Spanish company Ebro Puleva in February 2004.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted (     DSAL     ) on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid.

ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL     s co     operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.
