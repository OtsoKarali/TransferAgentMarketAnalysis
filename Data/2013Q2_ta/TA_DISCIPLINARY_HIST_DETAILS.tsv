The shares deposited with the registered representative did not contain any restrictions on resale or transfer according to the transfer agent who was in possession of a legal opinion addressing the available of an exemption to registration. Enforcement has argued that the representative and the firm had a heighted responsibility to conduct a further inquiry as to the resale of these shares.

The Regulator has penalized Invesco Taiwan because its investment on a particular stock was without reasonable grounds and justifications to support the decision. Invesco Taiwan bought and sold this stock with a small profit, and documented the rationale of the buying and selling. However, the Regulator believed that the rationale behind the decision to sell the security was not based upon reasonable grounds and justifications.

0000896852-13-000013	sraViolationOfRules	3	Van Kampen Funds Inc. (Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.)	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.	On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA.

(INVESCO)	Docket 03CV2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long term investments in certain non timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured ordered to cease and desist and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties.

INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US 110 Million. Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. formerly A I M Advisors as successor adviser to INVESCO Funds Group agreed to pay the penalty and disgorgement amounts ordered against INVESCO Funds Group on the following dates US 162.5 Million by December 31, 2004, and the remaining US 162.5 Million by December 31, 2005. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US 235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including maintaining a board of trustees that is 75 percent independent designating an independent Chairman of the Board maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years cooperating fully with the SEC maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant conducting periodic compliance reviews and retaining an independent distribution consultant.

Under this Act, anyone whose shareholding in a German issuer reaches, exceeds or falls below 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 50% or 75% of the voting rights shall notify the issuer and the BaFin, without undue delay, and within four trading days at the latest. The BaFin alleged that: (1) notifications sent by BNY Mellon on behalf of certain subsidiaries to a German issuer and the BaFin of the reduction of its voting shares in the issuer below the 3% threshold was one month late and (2) BNY Mellon failed to take the supervisory measures required under the Act to prevent contravention of the shareholding notice obligations by its subsidiaries. On May 12, 2011, the BaFin issued an administrative order that: (1) determined that BNY Mellon negligently failed to comply with the supervisory requirements with respect to its subsidiaries in order to ensure compliance with the notification deadlines and (2) imposed against BNY Mellon an administrative fine of EUR 22,500.00 (approx. $31,725) and a fee (for procedural costs) of EUR 1,125.00 (approx. $1,586).

It was alleged that due to a failure in its internal processes at the time, a portion of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper ('ABCP') collateral pledged by BNYM was ineligible under the terms of the AMLF. As a result, BNYM received more in the AMLF loans proceeds than it otherwise would have been advanced, based upon the eligible ABCP collateral pledged.	The BGFRS and BNYM have mutually agreed to enter into a combined Order to Cease & Desist and Order of Assessment of a Civil Monetary Penalty of $6,000,000.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Order No. 90-2525	23-NOV-2009	Division of Securities, Office of State Auditor, West Virginia (The 'Division')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 11/23/2009.  The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of Auction Rate Securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Consent Order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.  West Virginia Code Section 32-2-204 allows the Division, through its Administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) In connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.  West Virginia Code Section 32-4-407 allows the Division, through its Administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to a Consent Order entered by the Division on November 23, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the West Virginia Securities Division and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The Consent Order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a Term Sheet (the 'Term Sheet').

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct  in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the stipulation and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Utah Code Ann. Section 61-1-6(2)(A)(II)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Utah Code Ann. Section 61-1-6(2)(A)(II)(J) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.

Pursuant to a Consent Order entered by the Division on November 5, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $33,075.19 to the State of Delaware and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The Consent Order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a Term Sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $33,075.19 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The Consent Order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the Consent Order.

('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Wis. Stats.

Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on April 8, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $44,454.46 to the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $44,454.46 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.	Without admitting or denying the findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented to FINRA's findings, a censure, a fine of $1.25 mil. and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory proced. relating to adver. trade vol.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

In a notice served on two series trusts for which Mr. Miola served as chairman of the board of trustees, the SEC alleged that, during the period January 2009 through December 2010, the trustees of the trusts, including Mr. Miola, caused the trusts to violate certain federal securities laws. The SEC alleged that on certain occasions during the relevant period, disclosures included in shareholder reports concerning the trustees' evaluation process with respect to certain advisory contracts entered into by certain series of the trusts contained boilerplate disclosures that were materially untrue or misleading in violation of section 34(b) of the investment company act of 1940. Because such disclosures were made based on board minutes reviewed and approved by the trustees, the SEC deemed the violations to have been caused by the trustees. Also during the relevant period, the SEC deemed that the trustees were a cause of certain series' violations of rule 38a-1(a)(1) under the investment company act of 1940, which requires registered investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the trustees failed to implement those series' policies and procedures to the extent they required the series' CCO to provide the advisers' compliance manuals to the trustees for their review or, as an alternative, summaries of the compliance programs upon which the trustees could rely in approving the compliance manuals of the series' new advisers.	Mr. Miola agreed to cease and desist from committing any future violations and hire an independent compliance consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

The SEC alleged that NLCS, in its capacity as chief compliance officer to certain series formed under the trusts, together with the trustees, failed to ensure that certain series of the trusts implemented their policies and procedures concerning the items upon which the trustees could rely when the trustees approved certain investment advisor compliance programs based on NLCS's report that such advisers' compliance manuals were 'sufficient' and 'in use' and that their code of ethics and proxy voting policies were 'compliant.'  The SEC deemed that such failure constituted a violation of Rule 38a-1(a)(1) promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.	In settlement, NLCS agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations, pay a $50,000 fine, and hire an independent consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

The SEC alleged that the registrant in its capacity as fund administrator to certain series formed under the trusts, failed to ensure that certain shareholder reports contained adequate disclosure of the process by which the trustees evaluated the terms of certain advisory contracts entered into by the trusts, and in doing so violated Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 30(e)(1) promulgated thereunder. The SEC also alleged that the registrant failed to ensure that certain series of the trusts maintained and preserved copies of written materials that the trustees considered in reviewing and approving certain advisory contracts in violation of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2(a)(6) promulgated thereunder.	In settlement, registrant agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations, pay a $50,000 fine, and hire an independent consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume.

The fine was paid on 1/2/13.

During the period of July 2002 through June 2004, DBSI failed to include required conflict disclosures on its published reports in violation of NYSE Rule 472 (K).

The NYSE alleged that DBSI violated the above cited Rules by the conduct of a DBSI former registered representative who entered late trades for at least one customer. More specifically, the NYSE alleged that the registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares after 4:00 P.M. Eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades.

The NYSE further alleged that DBSI violated NYSE Rule 342 by failing to reasonably supervise the registered representative and failing to establish and maintain appropriate procedures for supervision and control effective to detect and prevent the registered representative's deceptive customer trading of mutual funds. DBSI, without admitting or denying the allegations or findings, consented to censure and total payment of $442,954.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

0001018490-13-000009	fsrFalseStatementOrOmission	77	Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	ODS File No. 09-142	01-FEB-2010	Department of Securities of the State of Oklahoma ('The Department')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 2/1/2010. The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Oklahoma Securities Commission Rule 660:11-5-42 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Oklahoma Securities Commission Rule 660:11-5-42 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on February 1, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $37,407.91 to the Oklahoma Securities Department and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid. ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007. On March 7, 2007, the ASX Issued a disciplinary circular naming DSAL and providing details of the offense and penalty imposed. A fine of a A$45,000 was imposed upon Deutsche Securities Australia Limited.	A fine of a A$45,000 was imposed upon Deutsche Securities Australia Limited.

The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.
