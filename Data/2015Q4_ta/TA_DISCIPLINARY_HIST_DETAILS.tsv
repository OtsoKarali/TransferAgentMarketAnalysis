('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a 55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions it its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through the real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a $2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.

('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Commissioner making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Commissioner is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.

Pursuant to a consent order executed on June 3, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $1,057,350.69 to New Jersey and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  DBSI also agreed to pay $15,000 to the North American Securities Administrators Association ('NASAA') as reimbursement for costs associated with NASAA'S assistance on NJ's investigation.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'August 31 Term Sheet').  The August 31 Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $1,057,350.69 penalty imposed by New Jersey is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Bureau Chief making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business in violation of N.J.S.A 49:3-58(A)(2)(VII); and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct, in violation of its duties under N.J.S.A. 49:3-58(A)(2)(XI).	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $1,057,350.69 to New Jersey, and also agreed to pay $15,000 to the North American Securities Administrators Association.

The Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, Division of Banking and Securities of the State of Alaska (the 'Division') alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.  A.S. 45.55.060(A)(7) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) In connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.  A.S. 45.55.060(B)(1) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the administrative consent order entered by the Division on December 23, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the State of Alaska and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The administrative consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to Alaska and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/2008.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a 2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.

0001018490-15-000025	sraFalseStatementOrOmission	3	Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'Firm') , a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	20080136798-01	14-DEC-2012	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 12/14/2012. FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.	Without admitting or denying the findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented to FINRA's findings, a censure, a fine of $1.25 mil. and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory proced. relating to adver. trade vol.

The Board alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Board making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 115.10(B)(1) of the Board rules allows the Board, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $827,886.15 penalty imposed by the Board is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The Commission alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI consented to the Commission making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. 70 P.S.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $33,252.25 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the administrative consent order.

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS') and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (i) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (ii) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (iii) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business, in violation of section 8.E(1)(b) of the Illinois Securities Act ('Act'); and (2) in connection with the failure to (i) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS; (ii) create and maintain adequate supervisory procedures concerning ARS; (iii) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents; and (iv) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct, in violation of its duties under section 8.E(1)(e)(i) of the act. The activities cited in the consent order are grounds, pursuant to the act, for the initiation of administrative proceedings, and, pursuant to the act, to impose such other remedial measures as may be necessary in the public interest. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on July 16, 2012, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $535,364.03 to the Illinois Secretary of State and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in august 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA that resulted in a term sheet (the 'term sheet'). The term sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $535,364.03 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedures for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Dept., without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $535,364.03 and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before Feb. 13, 2008.

The NASD charged violations of NASD Rules 2110, 2210(D)(1), and 2210(D)(2) in connection with alleged conflicts of interest resulting from investment banking influence over research analysts; the issuance of research reports affected by those conflicts of interest; payments to and from other securities firms and the receipt of payments from issuers for research; and the non-disclosure of such payments.  The NASD also charged violations of NASD Rule 3010 for allegedly not adequately supervising its research analysts in order to prevent conflicts of interests, as well as NASD Rule 2110 for allegedly not promptly producing e-mail.  The current status is closed on August 20, 2004.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent with the NASD and to pay $87.5 million.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.	Without admitting or denying the findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented to FINRA's findings, a censure, a fine of $1.25 mil. and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory proced. relating to adver. trade vol.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a 55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions it its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through the real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume.

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 36B-15(A)(2)(H) of the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 36B-31-6(F)(B) of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies enacted pursuant to the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on August 9, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $343,481.09 to the Treasurer of the State of Connecticut and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $343,481.09 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $343,481.09 to the Treas. of St. of Connecticut and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Idaho Code Section 30-14-412(D)(13) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Idaho Code Section 30-14-412(D)(9) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on April 8, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Idaho Department of Finance and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Idaho Department of Finance and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the administrative consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. The South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. The South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the administrative consent order entered by the Division on March 11, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $33,252.25 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The administrative consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $33,252.25 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the administrative consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the admin. cons. order, on 3/11/10, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $33,252.25 to the Div. of Sec. and take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings that it failed to adequately ensure that it maintained a complete record of all free-credits due to customers.

The findings also included that instead, the firm relied on a bank statement to determine the credit amounts to include in its reserve formula; the bank statement did not reflect checks that the firm received on the date of the bank statement.

0001202048-15-000019	subjectOfProceedings	1	The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ('VALIC')	Injunction	06-AUG-2015	West Virginia Securities Commission in West Virginia	In twenty-four separate summary orders (the 'Summary Orders'), the West Virginia Securities Commission (the 'Commission') has alleged that between 1990 to 1994: (1) VALIC acted as an investment adviser by conducting investment advisory services in the state of West Virginia ('WV') without benefit of registration in violation of WV Code Section 32-2-201(c); (2) a VALIC advertisement had not been filed with the Commission before it was distributed in violation of WV Code Section 32-4-403; (3) VALIC and its agent defrauded investors by misleading them to switch from WV's defined benefit plan to the defined contribution plan, by misrepresenting material facts and implying they were representatives of the school board or the state in violation of WV Codes Section 32-1-101 and Section 32-1-102(a); (4) statements and/or omissions made by a VALIC agent in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of any security directly or indirectly were misleading and constituted a scheme to defraud WV residents in violation of WV Code Sections 32-1-101 et seq.; and (5) the failure of VALIC's agent to disclose to his client that he was employed and controlled by VALIC while assisting in his client's retirement plan constitutes a dishonest or unethical practice in the securities business in accordance with WV Code Section 32-2-204(b)(23). On August 20, 2015, VALIC sent written responses to the WV State Auditor's Office and the Commission, which response sets forth VALIC's objections to the Summary Orders. Based on those objections, VALIC has requested that the Summary Orders be withdrawn or, alternatively, that an administrative hearing be scheduled as soon as possible so that VALIC may present its complete response to the allegations in the Summary Orders. VALIC's objections to the Summary Orders are as follows: (1) VALIC is concerned with the circumstances in which the Summary Orders were transmitted to VALIC. The Summary Orders were transmitted to VALIC by outside counsel to WV ('WV Counsel'), which firm is representing the WV Investment Management Board (IMB) and the Consolidated Public Retirement Board (CPRB) in pending litigation against VALIC in which a trial is scheduled to commence in March 2016. Additionally, shortly before a court-ordered mediation in that action in May 2015, WV Counsel threatened VALIC with service of the Summary Orders, notwithstanding that the relevant inquiry, which dated back to 2008, had long been entirely dormant. VALIC further asserts that the Summary Orders were politically motivated and not based on any legitimate concerns about the legality of VALIC's conduct. Thus, it is VALIC's belief that the Summary Orders represent an improper attempt by WV Counsel to use authority vested in him by the state to exert leverage in pending litigation. (2) VALIC also asserts that the allegations in the Summary Orders are completely lacking of merit and that the deficiencies in the Summary Orders are as follows: (i) The Commission lacks jurisdiction over VALIC's products and practices; (ii) VALIC did not offer investment advice, much less do so as an unregistered investment adviser receiving special compensation; (iii) The conduct alleged occurred in the 1990s and, even if accurately described, (which it is not), any claims based on that conduct would be time-barred by applicable statues of limitations; and (iv) Several of the statutory provisions cited in the Summary Orders were not passed into law until after the alleged conduct by VALIC's representatives and therefore cannot apply to the conduct.	The matter is still pending. As of September 22, 2015, neither the WV State Auditor's Office nor the Commission has scheduled the hearing requested by VALIC. Details of VALIC's objection to the Summary Orders are summarized in the item 10(g)(v) above.
