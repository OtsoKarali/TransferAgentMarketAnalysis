INVESCO	Docket 03CV2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long term investments in certain non timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured ordered to cease and desist and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted (""DSAL"") on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid. ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (""DBSI""): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities (""ARS""), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Ind. Code section 23-19-4-12(D)(13) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Ind. Code section 23-19-4-12(D)(9) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order entered by the Division on January 8, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $36,504.51 to the Indiana Secretary of State Securities Division and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the ""Term Sheet""). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $36,504.51 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."

On January 30, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") entered into a final notice under Principle 3 (Management and Control) and Senior Management Arrangements. Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

On January 30, 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services (""DFS""), DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch entered into a consent Order under New York Banking Law Sections 33,44 and 44-A. Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R. R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C. DBAG and DBAG's New York branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York branch: (a) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017; and (b) engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing Bank Secrecy Act (""BSA"")/ Anti-Money Laundering (""AML"") compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York branch recommend corrective actions, and oversee the implementation of corrective actions the DFS deems necessary. The Order requires DBAG to engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the Order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing BSA/AML compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York branch. The independent monitor must submit to DBAG a written report on its findings and recommendations. Sixty days thereafter, DBAG must submit to the DFS a written action plan to improve and enhance its BSA/AML compliance programs, after which the DFS will determine which recommendations DBAG should implement. The independent monitor will thereafter oversee the implementation of the recommendations, assess DBAG's compliance with the corrective measures, and submit additional reports or recommendations as necessary. The Order required DBAG to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $425 million, which the Firm paid on February 3, 2017."	DBAG and DBAG's New York branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by the DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York branch: (a) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017.

FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume.

The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360 (B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period of February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360 (B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014). Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (""AWC"") consenting to a censure, undertaking, and a fine of $1,403,334.00.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls). DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting. CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014. CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC. CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system. CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking & Securities division business, (1)its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers to inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) it AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective systems for monitoring money flows associated with transactions; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant to which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rules into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Laws 44 and 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R.R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C. DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by the DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch: (a) shall pay a civil and monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017; and (b) engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the Order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing BSA/AML compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York Branch recommend corrective actions, and oversee the implementation of corrective actions the DFS deems necessary.

The independent monitor will thereafter oversee the implementation of the recommendations, assess DBAG's compliance with the corrective measures, and submit additional reports or recommendations as necessary.

The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced. The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known. The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules. Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

(""KDI""); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

On January 30, 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services (""DFS""), DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch entered into a consent Order under New York Banking Law Sections 33,44 and 44-A. Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R. R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C. DBAG and DBAG's New York branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York branch: (a) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017; and (b) engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing Bank Secrecy Act (""BSA"")/ Anti-Money Laundering (""AML"") compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York branch recommend corrective actions, and oversee the implementation of corrective actions the DFS deems necessary.

The independent monitor must submit to DBAG a written report on its findings and recommendations. Sixty days thereafter, DBAG must submit to the DFS a written action plan to improve and enhance its BSA/AML compliance programs, after which the DFS will determine which recommendations DBAG should implement. The independent monitor will thereafter oversee the implementation of the recommendations, assess DBAG's compliance with the corrective measures, and submit additional reports or recommendations as necessary.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $146,719.76 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."

In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for acting in concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC.

The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC.

Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking & Securities division business, (1)its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers to inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) it AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective systems for monitoring money flows associated with transactions; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant to which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time.
