CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

0000896852-12-000006	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

0000896852-12-000006	falseStatementOrOmission	1	INVESCO Funds Group Inc. INVESCO	Docket 03CV2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long term investments in certain non timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US 110 Million.

0000896852-12-000004	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

Invesco Taiwan bought and sold this stock with a small profit, and documented the rationale of the buying and selling. However, the Regulator believed that the rationale behind the decision to sell the security was not based upon reasonable grounds and justifications.	The Regulator imposed a fine on Invesco Taiwan of NT 120,000 dollars which is approximately US 4,000 dollars.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.

0000896852-12-000002	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.
