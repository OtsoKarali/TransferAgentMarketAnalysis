The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

0001018490-16-000034	violationOfRegulations	15	Deutsche Bank AG ('DBAG'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	SEC File No. 3-16557	26-MAY-2015	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 5/26/2015. On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a 2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.  The fine was paid on October 5, 2015.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 110A. section 204(A)(2)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 110A. section 204(A)(2)(J) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the administrative consent order entered by the Division on January 26, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $3,210,161.72 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The administrative consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $3,210,161.72 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $3,210,161.72 to the Division of Sec. and take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

Deutsche Securities Korea. CO. ('DSK'). On August 19, 2011, The Korean Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office filed a criminal indictment against DSK for vicarious criminal liability for negligence in supervising the acts of one of the four individuals, which was a DSK employee.  DSK is a broker dealer in Korea that is a subsidiary of DBAG and an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  The subject KOSPI Matter involves the allegation that the DB's equity traders based in Hong Kong and in DSK manipulated the closing KOSPI200 Index on Nov 10, 2010, when they sold a large basket of stocks worth approx. USD 1.6 Billion, when unwinding an index arbitrage position.  During the closing auction on that day the KOSPI200 fell by approx. 2.7%.  The equity traders had various other positions that resulted in a profit arising from the fall in the index.  The FSS and the Korean prosecutors investigated the matter in 2011.  A criminal indictment was filed against three ex-employees of DB Hong Kong and one employee of DSK and against DSK for vicarious criminal liability for the acts of its employee.  The criminal trial commenced in Jan 2012 with a decision at the first trial level rendered on January 25, 2016.  Appeals have been filed and are pending .  While Korea is a jurisdiction that does not differentiate between a felony and misdemeanor, the eventual punishment rendered against DSK in Jan 2016, a fine over $1000, now makes it clear that this event falls under the definition of a felony as provided in the Form BD definitions.  DSK was convicted on 1/25/2016.  DSK was subject to a criminal fine of KRW 1.5 Billion (Approx. USD 1.25M) and forfeiture of illegal profits.  The prosecutor has filed an appeal and DSK has filed a counter-appeal.  There is no final due date set for the criminal fine due to the pending appeals.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid.

Pursuant to the AOD, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $678,282.50 to New York and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.

The August 31 Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000, and the $678,282.50 penalty imposed by the NYAG is New York's pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The AOD requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the AOD. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the NYAG, DBSI agreed to certain relief as described above. The AOD stated that the acts and practices of DBSI as described in the AOD violated: (1) The Martin Act, Article 23-A of the NY General Business Law, (2) Section 349 of the NY General Business Law, and (3) Section 63(12) of the NY Executive Law.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.

The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $343,481.09 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The administrative consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a 55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions it its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through the real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.  DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00.  The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a 2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Miss. Code Ann. Section 75-71-321(A)(F) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Miss. Code Ann. Section 75-71-321(B)(A) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on May 10, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Mississippi Office of the Secretary of State and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Mississippi Off. of Sec. of St. and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.

The SEC alleged that the registrant, in its capacity as fund administrator to certain series formed under the trusts, failed to ensure that certain shareholder reports contained adequate disclosure of the process by which the trustees evaluated the terms of certain advisory contracts entered into by the trusts and, in doing so, violated Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 30(e)(1) promulgated thereunder. The SEC also alleged that the registrant failed to ensure that certain series of the trusts maintained and preserved copies of written materials that the trustees considered in reviewing and approving certain advisory contracts in violation of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2(a)(6) promulgated thereunder.	In settlement, registrant agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations, pay a $50,000 fine, and hire an independent consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

The SEC alleged that NLCS, in its capacity as chief compliance offer to certain series formed under the trusts, together with the trustees, failed to ensure that certain series of the trusts implemented their policies and procedures concerning the items upon which the trustees could rely when the trustees approved certain investment advisor compliance programs based on NLCS's report that such advisers' compliance manuals were 'sufficient' and 'in use' and that their code of ethics and proxy voting policies were 'compliant.' The SEC deemed that such failure constituted a violation of Rule 38a-1(a)(1) promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.	In settlement, NLCS agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations, pay a $50,000 fine, and hire an independent consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

In a notice served on two series trusts for which Mr. Miola served as chairman of the Board of Trustees, the SEC alleged that, during the period January 2009 through December 2010, the trustees of the trusts, including Mr. Miola, caused the trusts to violate certain federal securities laws. The SEC alleged that, on certain occasions during the relevant period, disclosures included in shareholder reports concerning the trustees' evaluation process with respect to certain advisory contracts entered into by certain series of the trusts contained boilerplate disclosures that were materially untrue or misleading in violation of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because such disclosures were made based on board minutes reviewed and approved by the trustees, the SEC deemed the violations to have been caused by the trustees. Also during the relevant period, the SEC deemed that the trustees were a cause of certain series' violations of Rule 38a-1(a)(1) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires registered investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the trustees failed to implement those series' policies and procedures to the extent they required the series' chief compliance officer to provide the adviser's compliance manuals to the trustees for their review, or as an alternative, summaries of the compliance programs upon which the trustees could rely in approving the compliance manuals of the series' new advisers.	Mr. Miola agreed to cease and desist from committing any future violations and hire an independent compliance consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

0000896852-16-000015	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

The issues identified by the FCA related to the period May 2008 to November 2012 and included the following: 1) Investment restriction breaches in UK-domiciled retail funds managed by Invesco Perpetual, such breaches had been identified by Invesco Perpetual and reported to FCA, and the Funds were promptly reimbursed where necessary. 2) Disclosures regarding the use of, and risks associated with, derivatives were not made or inadequately made in disclosure documents for two UK-domiciled retail funds managed by Invesco Perpetual. These disclosures failings were corrected in August 2012. 3) Invesco Perpetual failed to adequately document allocations of fixed income securities when aggregating client orders. A review by Invesco Perpetual determined there was no evidence that this impacted investors. 4) Certain fixed income transactions were not posted on a timely basis. This did not result in any need to reprice funds.	The Financial Conduct Authority imposed a financial penalty of GBP 18.6 million which is approximately US 31.1 million.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Order No. 11-013	21-MAR-2011	Division of Securities of the Dept. of Commerce of St. of Ohio ('The Division')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter:  Initiation date: 3/21/2011.  The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.  ORC Sections 1707.19(A)(4),(9) allow the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.  ORC Sections 1707.19(A)(4),(9) and Ohio Administrative Code Rule 1301:6-3-19(B)(9) allow the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on March 21, 2011, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $110,583.61 to the Ohio Division of Securities' Investor Education and Enforcement Expense Fund and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $110,583.61 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $110,583.61 to the Ohio Div. of Sec. Inv. Ed. and Enf. Exp. Fd. and to take certain measures with respect to clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/2008.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting.  CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.  DBAG agreed to pay a 2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp.

Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued 'GAP Risk' associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior ('LLS') synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis.  GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty.  During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk.  The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue.  The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.  The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).  DBAG paid a 55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.  CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through the real time public tape and to the CFTC.  CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system.  CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The Administrative Consent Order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the Consent Order.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.

The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.

The Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation of the Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth of the State of Michigan ('the Office')  alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Office making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. MCL 451.604(A)(1)(G) allows the Office, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,722.72 penalty imposed by the Office is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

0001202048-16-000025	subjectOfProceedings	1	The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ('VALIC')	Injunction	06-AUG-2015	West Virginia Securities Commission in West Virginia	In twenty-four separate summary orders (the 'Summary Orders'), the West Virginia Securities Commission (the 'Commission') has alleged that between 1990 to 1994: (1) VALIC acted as an investment adviser by conducting investment advisory services in the state of West Virginia ('WV') without benefit of registration in violation of WV Code Section 32-2-201(c); (2) a VALIC advertisement had not been filed with the Commission before it was distributed in violation of WV Code Section 32-4-403; (3) VALIC and its agent defrauded investors by misleading them to switch from WV's defined benefit plan to the defined contribution plan, by misrepresenting material facts and implying they were representatives of the school board or the state in violation of WV Codes Section 32-1-101 and Section 32-1-102(a); (4) statements and/or omissions made by a VALIC agent in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of any security directly or indirectly were misleading and constituted a scheme to defraud WV residents in violation of WV Code Sections 32-1-101 et seq.; and (5) the failure of VALIC's agent to disclose to his client that he was employed and controlled by VALIC while assisting in his client's retirement plan constitutes a dishonest or unethical practice in the securities business in accordance with WV Code Section 32-2-204(b)(23). On August 20, 2015, VALIC sent written responses to the WV State Auditor's Office and the Commission, which response sets forth VALIC's objections to the Summary Orders. Based on those objections, VALIC has requested that the Summary Orders be withdrawn or, alternatively, that an administrative hearing be scheduled as soon as possible so that VALIC may present its complete response to the allegations in the Summary Orders. VALIC's objections to the Summary Orders are as follows: (1) VALIC is concerned with the circumstances in which the Summary Orders were transmitted to VALIC. The Summary Orders were transmitted to VALIC by outside counsel to WV ('WV Counsel'), which firm is representing the WV Investment Management Board (IMB) and the Consolidated Public Retirement Board (CPRB) in pending litigation against VALIC in which a trial is scheduled to commence in March 2016. Additionally, shortly before a court-ordered mediation in that action in May 2015, WV Counsel threatened VALIC with service of the Summary Orders, notwithstanding that the relevant inquiry, which dated back to 2008, had long been entirely dormant. VALIC further asserts that the Summary Orders were politically motivated and not based on any legitimate concerns about the legality of VALIC's conduct. Thus, it is VALIC's belief that the Summary Orders represent an improper attempt by WV Counsel to use authority vested in him by the state to exert leverage in pending litigation. (2) VALIC also asserts that the allegations in the Summary Orders are completely lacking of merit and that the deficiencies in the Summary Orders are as follows: (i) The Commission lacks jurisdiction over VALIC's products and practices; (ii) VALIC did not offer investment advice, much less do so as an unregistered investment adviser receiving special compensation; (iii) The conduct alleged occurred in the 1990s and, even if accurately described, (which it is not), any claims based on that conduct would be time-barred by applicable statues of limitations; and (iv) Several of the statutory provisions cited in the Summary Orders were not passed into law until after the alleged conduct by VALIC's representatives and therefore cannot apply to the conduct.	The matter is still pending. As of September 22, 2015, neither the WV State Auditor's Office nor the Commission has scheduled the hearing requested by VALIC. Details of VALIC's objection to the Summary Orders are summarized in the item 10(g)(v) above.
