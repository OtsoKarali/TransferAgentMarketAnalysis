DBTCA, formerly known as Bankers Trust Company, is the principal United States banking subsidiary of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft ('DBAG'). SerAms does not have any third party client agreements. Rather, SerAms, as engaged by DBTCA, provides technical and administrative support services including data processing, telecommunications, maintenance of appropriate records in accordance with existing standards, recordkeeping and accounting functions in connection with services provided to DBTCA's customers (or DBTCA's customers' customers, in the case of DBTCA's private label business for certain affiliates); and DBTCA has appointed SerAms as its agent to act on its behalf in connection with the transfer of securities and other instruments. Accounts are maintained jointly by DBTCA and SerAms. SerAms in its transfer agent function provides services to DBTCA in a manner as if SerAms is an independent, dedicated contractor that works solely for DBTCA and no other transfer agent. There is a shared system of database for DBTCA and SerAms. An example is escheatment - the details of escheatment are maintained by SerAms while the remission to the states is done in the name of and on behalf of DBTCA. SerAms management is responsible to the business line management of DBAG and DBAG affiliates/subsidiaries including DBTCA. The business line unit head of ServAms reports to business line unit management of DBAG/affiliate. Audits are performed by DBAG's Audit Department. Examinations of DBAG NY branch and subsidiary bank, DBTCA, are performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Department of Financial Services. DBAG provides for SerAms the infrastructure necessary to insure safety and soundness measures including accounting systems, the Legal Department, the Internal Audit Department, Compliance, Human Resources and technology functions.
