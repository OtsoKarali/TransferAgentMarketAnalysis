The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.

(INVESCO)	Docket #03-CV-2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds? prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long-term investments in certain non-timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements.

Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors? consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

CIBC Mellon Trust Company	14-JAN-2005	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	CIBC Mellon Trust Company (?CMTC?), a transfer agent that is an affiliate of Registrant by virtue of Mellon Canada Holding Company?s 50 percent interest in the joint venture, submitted a Consent to Entry of Judgment (the ?Consent?) which was presented by the SEC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the ?Court?) on February 16, 2005. In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC?s investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the ?Final Judgment?) without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued ?legend free? stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company?s officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint?s allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the ?Order?). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10B(1) and 10C(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent.  See item (v) above for detail.

The SEC alleged that from 1992 to mid-1995, FAM?s predecessor company (?Old Founders?) used brokerage commissions generated from certain small privately managed accounts to compensate an unaffiliated registered representative for client referrals without making adequate disclosure in its Form ADV or otherwise, and that Old Founders failed to adequately disclose the effect of a change in its trade allocation policy which resulted in delayed execution of trades in these small, privately managed accounts.  FAM consented to the entry of an administrative order by the SEC relating to Old Founders? brokerage practices from 1992 to mid-1995 for certain small private accounts.  FAM consented to the SEC order without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings and under the terms of the settlement, FAM, as successor to Old Founders, agreed to a censure, cease and desist order and a $50,000 penalty.  During the relevant time period, Old Founders was under the ownership and direction of Bjorn K. Borgen.  Borgen also entered into a settlement with the SEC related to this matter.  Borgen agreed to a cease and desist order, a 180-day suspension, disgorgement of $590,000 (with credit for $85,000 previously paid by Old Founders to clients, for a net disgorgement amount of $505,000) and a penalty of $150,000.

0001285911-07-000011	violationOfRegulations	1	The Dreyfus Corporation	In the Matter of The Dreyfus Corporation, Respondent	07-SEP-2006	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.

SEC named The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) a respondent in administrative proceedings which had previously been instituted concerning an unaffiliated securities analyst and several unaffiliated investment advisory firms with respect to allegations of misuse of material nonpublic information in connection with trading in securities of Equity Funding Corporation of America ('Equity Funding').  The allegations against Dreyfus, which did not include material monetary damages, involved a transaction in March 1973 when the Dreyfus Special Income Fund, Inc. (currently, The Dreyfus Convertible Securities Fund, Inc.), which is managed by Dreyfus, sold $500,000 face amount of convertible subordinated debentures of Equity Funding for proceeds of $353,759 (cost $380,000).  An SEC administrative law judge rendered a decision in which, among other matters, he found that Dreyfus had sold securities on the basis of material nonpublic information concerning Equity Funding without making full disclosure to the buyer, but that in this case, the imposition of a sanction was not deemed necessary.

Schonberg	10-MAY-2000	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	The SEC issued an Order Instituting Proceedings, Making Findings, Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Ordering Respondents to Cease and Desist (the ?Order?).

Dreyfus, without admitting or denying any liability and in settlement of the proceeding, consented to certain findings of violations of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 17(j) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to the imposition of a cease and desist order relating to such findings, a nine month suspension of the fund?s former portfolio manager, a fine of $950,000 to be paid by Dreyfus, a fine of $50,000 to paid by the former portfolio manager and the retention by Dreyfus of an independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of Dreyfus?s policies and procedures relating to IPOs, performance advertising and personal securities transactions.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid.

ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL?s co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.
