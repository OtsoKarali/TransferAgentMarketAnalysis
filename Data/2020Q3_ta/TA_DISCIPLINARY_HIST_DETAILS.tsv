(""KDI""); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report its OCEND in one symbol. The findings also stated that the Firm failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for acting in concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC.

Specifically, the Federal Reserve determined that, as a result of the deficiencies identified in the Order, DBAG had not implemented a compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with Volcker Rule requirements and had engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices and violated provisions of the Volcker Rule.

Section 1818(B) and 12 U.S. C. Section 1818 (I). Specifically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board found that (A) the most recent examination of the BSA/AML program at DBTCA and the New York branch conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified significant deficiencies in DBTCA's and the branch's risk management and compliance with BSA/AML requirements that resulted in a violation of the Regulatory Compliance Program requirement, and (B) deficiencies in DBTCA's transaction monitoring capabilities prevented DBTCA from properly assessing BSA/AML risk for billions of dollars in certain potentially suspicious transactions. Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG's New York Branch, DB USA Corporation, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas consented to the entry of the Order signed on May 26, 2017 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to which Deutsche Bank (A) committed to pay a civil money penalty of $41 million, which Deutsche Bank paid on June 6, 2017; and (B) committed to affirmative obligations including the retention of independent third parties to review DBTCA's compliance with applicable BSA/AML requirements and to conduct a transaction review of DBTCA's foreign correspondent banking activity from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016; and the submission of several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, and monitoring. These obligations have various due dates beginning 30 days after the Order was signed. The Order imposes affirmative obligations including the retention of independent third parties to review DBTCA's compliance with applicable BSA/AML requirements and to conduct a transaction review of DBTCA's foreign correspondent banking activity from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The Order also requires certain Deutsche Bank entities to submit several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, monitoring, and reporting functions. The Order required DBAG to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $41 million, which the Firm paid on June 6, 2017.	Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG's New York Branch, DB USA Corporation, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company America consented to the entry of the Order signed on May 26, 2017 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank.

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking & Securities division business, (1)its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers to inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) it AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective systems for monitoring money flows associated with transactions; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant to which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rules into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Laws 44 and 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R.R.

The Order also requires certain Deutsche Bank entities to submit several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, monitoring, and reporting functions.

Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R.

In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls). DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015. DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00. The fine was paid on June 9, 2015."	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00. The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting. CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014. CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC. CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system. CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014.

0001787835-20-000005	sraViolationOfRules	4	Merrill Lynch Commodities (Europe) Limited	NASDAQ OMX Commodities Oslo ASA	04-JUL-2013	NASDAQ OMX Commodities Oslo ASA	On June 15, 2013, the Exchange alleged that Merrill Lynch Commodities (Europe) Limited (MLCE) on two occasions offered sell orders on the Exchange which lowered the best asking price of an Exchange product. While offering the sell orders MLCE allegedly bought larger quantities in the over-the-counter market and paid the same price as the price of its sell orders. The Exchange found that the sell orders gave or were likely to give misleading signals as to the supply and price of the Exchange product, and that the sell orders most likely were offered with intent to improperly influence the trading of other market participants. The Exchange therefore determined that MLCE violated the prohibition against market manipulation set out in the Market Conduct Rules, section 5.1. The Exchange further deemed it to be mitigating that the potential benefit from the manipulative activity was limited.	USD$57,329.02 (NOK350.000) Monetary/Fine

While offering the sell orders MLCE allegedly bought larger quantities in the over-the-counter market and paid the same price as the price of its sell orders. The Exchange found that the sell orders gave or were likely to give misleading signals as to the supply and price of the Exchange product, and that the sell orders most likely were offered with intent to improperly influence the trading of other market participants. The Exchange therefore determined that MLCE violated the prohibition against market manipulation set out in the Market Conduct Rules, section 5.1. The Exchange further deemed it to be mitigating that the potential benefit from the manipulative activity was limited.	USD$57,329.02 (NOK350.000) Monetary/Fine

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.
