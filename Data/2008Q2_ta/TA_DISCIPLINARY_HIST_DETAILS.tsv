Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with than investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.  The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

0000909567-08-000517	falseStatementOrOmission	1	INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (INVESCO)	Docket #03-CV-2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds? prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long-term investments in certain non-timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds? prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors? consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding: The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured; ordered to cease and desist; and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(D) and 34(B) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D-1, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US$215 Million. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US$110 Million. Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. (formerly, A I M Advisors), as successor adviser to INVESCO Funds Group, agreed to pay the penalty and disgorgement amounts ordered against INVESCO Funds Group on the following dates: US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2004, and the remaining US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2005. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US$235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market-timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including: maintaining a board of trustees that is 75% independent; designating an independent Chairman of the Board; maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees; holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years; cooperating fully with the SEC; maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman; retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant; conducting periodic compliance reviews; and retaining an independent distribution consultant.	SEC proceeding settled Oct 8, 2004. INVESCO was censured; ordered to cease and desist; ordered to disgorge profits of $215 Million; ordered to pay civil money penalties of $110 Million; and remedial sanctions.

A I M Advisors and A I M Distributors led the AIM Fund Trustees to believe that A I M Advisors was diligently enforcing the per-year 10-exchange limit. A I M Advisors breached its fiduciary duty to AIM Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the Trustees of the AIM Funds or to the AIM Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the Trustees? Consent to the timing agreements. A I M Distributors negotiated and approved market timing agreements, and provided materially misleading information about A I M Advisors? market timing and prevention efforts to the Trustees of the AIM Funds. A I M Advisors and A I M Distributors financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, neither A I M Advisors nor A I M Distributors admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding: The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. A I M Advisors and A I M Distributors were censured; ordered to cease and desist; and are subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. Each of A I M Advisors and A I M Distributors was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(D) and 34(B) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D-1, and was ordered to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of US$20 Million within 30 days of the settlement.

INVESCO Funds Group violated its fiduciary duties by failing to disclose the timing arrangements to the investing public. The marketing timing transactions caused substantial dilution and other harm to the long-term shareholders of the INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations contained in the Assurance of Discontinuance. The disposition of the proceeding: The Attorney General proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist, and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from engaging in any acts in violation of the Martin Act, General Business Law Section 349 and/or Executive Law Section 63(12), and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US$215 Million, and a civil money penalty of US$110 Million in accordance with the SEC Order.
