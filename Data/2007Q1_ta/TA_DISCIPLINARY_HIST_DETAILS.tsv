Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

The SEC issued an Order Instituting Proceedings, Making Findings, Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Ordering Respondents to Cease and Desist (the ?Order?).

0001285911-07-000007	violationOfRegulations	1	The Dreyfus Corporation	In the Matter of The Dreyfus Corporation, Respondent	07-SEP-2006	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.

0001277690-07-000008	subjectOfProceedings	1	CIBC World Markets plc	The French Government v. CIBC World Markets plc et al / Court #0305792509	22-MAR-2005	Office of first examining magistrate of court of first instance, Paris, France	The French Government charged CIBC World Markets plc (?CIBC WM plc?) and a number of other defendants in relation to fees charged for investment banking advice given by CIBC WM plc in 2001 to a French company, SAS Holco, in its successful bid to acquire companies in the bankrupt AOM ? Air Libert? Group (?AirLib?).  CIBC WM plc. was charged with ?recel?, which is broadly equivalent to receiving misapplied corporate assets in the nature of exorbitant investment banking fees.   Subsequent to the acquisition AirLib went bankrupt again.  Thereafter, the French Parliament convened an inquiry, which reported in June 2003.  Neither CIBC WM plc. nor any of its employees were called as witnesses in the inquiry.  Following publication of the inquiry report, the French public prosecutor requested that an investigating judge investigate the matter formally. CIBC WM plc cooperated fully in the investigation.	Trial to commence in June, 2007.
0001277690-07-000008	violationOfRegulations	4	The Dreyfus Corporation	Not available.	01-JAN-1976	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	SEC named The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) a respondent in administrative proceedings which had previously been instituted concerning an unaffiliated securities analyst and several unaffiliated investment advisory firms with respect to allegations of misuse of material nonpublic information in connection with trading in securities of Equity Funding Corporation of America ('Equity Funding').  The allegations against Dreyfus, which did not include material monetary damages, involved a transaction in March 1973 when the Dreyfus Special Income Fund, Inc. (currently, The Dreyfus Convertible Securities Fund, Inc.), which is managed by Dreyfus, sold $500,000 face amount of convertible subordinated debentures of Equity Funding for proceeds of $353,759 (cost $380,000).  An SEC administrative law judge rendered a decision in which, among other matters, he found that Dreyfus had sold securities on the basis of material nonpublic information concerning Equity Funding without making full disclosure to the buyer, but that in this case, the imposition of a sanction was not deemed necessary.	SEC Administrative Law Judge decision.  See item (v) above for detail.
0001277690-07-000008	violationOfRegulations	1	The Dreyfus Corporation	In the Matter of The Dreyfus Corporation, Respondent	07-SEP-2006	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.  See item (v) above for detail.

The Boston Company (?TBC?) was found by the SEC to have materially overstated its income figures for the first three quarters of 1988.  Based on these findings, the SEC concluded that in 1988 TBC caused violations of section 13(A) and 13(B)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and rules 12 (B)-20, 13A-13 and 13B2-1 promulgated thereunder.  Accordingly, TBC is required to permanently cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of such provisions of the securities laws.  The Commission accepted TBC?s offer of settlement with respect to public administrative proceedings instituted by the SEC pursuant to section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Without admitting or denying the matters set forth in the SEC?s order instituting proceedings, TBC consented to the issuance of the order and to the entry of the findings contained therein.  The order contains no findings which could suggest any misapplication or diversion of client assets.	Order issued on consent.  See item (v) above for detail.

FAM consented to the SEC order without admitting or denying the SEC?s findings and under the terms of the settlement, FAM, as successor to Old Founders, agreed to a censure, cease and desist order and a $50,000 penalty.

The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.

The Boston Company (?TBC?) was found by the SEC to have materially overstated its income figures for the first three quarters of 1988.

Accordingly, TBC is required to permanently cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of such provisions of the securities laws.

(currently, The Dreyfus Convertible Securities Fund, Inc.), which is managed by Dreyfus, sold $500,000 face amount of convertible subordinated debentures of Equity Funding for proceeds of $353,759 (cost $380,000).  An SEC administrative law judge rendered a decision in which, among other matters, he found that Dreyfus had sold securities on the basis of material nonpublic information concerning Equity Funding without making full disclosure to the buyer, but that in this case, the imposition of a sanction was not deemed necessary.	SEC Administrative Law Judge decision.  See item (v) above for detail.

0000842657-07-000006	falseStatementOrOmission	1	Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	File No. 3-12514	19-JAN-2007	United States Securities and  Exchange Commission.	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Amended filing date: 12/21/2006. On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (?DBSI?) in connection with DBSI?s alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C-1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with than investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.  The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

('CLS'), now known as Clarke Lanzen Skalla Investment Firm, LLC, an affiliated company of Gemini Fund Services, LLC ('Gemini'), and W. Patrick Clarke, a Manager of Gemini, to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of Section 7(a) and 12(d) of the Investment Company Act, and of Sections 5(A) and 5(C) of the Securities Act of 1933. This cease and desist order originated from a routine SEC audit, wherein the SEC determined that CLS's 'MAAP II' investment service violated certain regulatory statues. The MAAP II investment service invested pooled assets in a substantially similar manner exclusively in shares of mutual funds. The SEC claimed that the pool of nominally separate MAAP II accounts constituted a de facto unregistered investment company. In addition, the SEC claimed that the MAAP II investment service constituted a fund of funds by purchasing shares of other investment companies in excess of statutory limits and in failing to register the MAAP II investment service, CLS sold an unregistered product. CLS voluntarily ceased offering the MAAP II investment service prior to the official issuance of the cease and desist order on June 16, 1995. No penalties or fines were imposed on CLS or against W. Patrick Clarke.	CLS was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain sections of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. No penalties, fines or payments were imposed.

The SEC alleged that from 1992 to mid-1995, FAM?s predecessor company (?Old Founders?) used brokerage commissions generated from certain small privately managed accounts to compensate an unaffiliated registered representative for client referrals without making adequate disclosure in its Form ADV or otherwise, and that Old Founders failed to adequately disclose the effect of a change in its trade allocation policy which resulted in delayed execution of trades in these small, privately managed accounts.

The Boston Company (?TBC?) was found by the SEC to have materially overstated its income figures for the first three quarters of 1988.  Based on these findings, the SEC concluded that in 1988 TBC caused violations of section 13(A) and 13(B)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and rules 12 (B)-20, 13A-13 and 13B2-1 promulgated thereunder.  Accordingly, TBC is required to permanently cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of such provisions of the securities laws.  The Commission accepted TBC?s offer of settlement with respect to public administrative proceedings instituted by the SEC pursuant to section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

0000944496-07-000003	violationOfRegulations	1	The Dreyfus Corporation	In the Matter of The Dreyfus Corporation, Respondent	07-SEP-2006	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.
