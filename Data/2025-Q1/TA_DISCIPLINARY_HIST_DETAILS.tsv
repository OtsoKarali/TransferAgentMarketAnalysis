Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

(""DSK"").On August 19, 2011, The Korean Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office filed a criminal indictment against DSK for vicarious criminal liability for negligence in supervising the acts of one of the four individuals, which was a DSK employee. DSK is a broker dealer in Korea that is a subsidiary of DBAG and an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. The subject KOSPI Matter involves the allegation that the DB's equity traders based in Hong Kong and in DSK manipulated the closingKOSPI200 Index on Nov 10, 2010, when they sold a large basket of stocks worth approx. USD 1.6 Billion, when unwinding an index arbitrage position. During the closing auction on that day the KOSPI200 fell by approx. 2.7%. The equity traders had various other positions that resulted in a profit arising from the fall in the index. The FSS and the Korean prosecutor investigated the matter in 2011. A criminal indictment was filed against three ex-employees of DB Hong Kong and one employee of DSK and against DSK for vicarious criminal liability for the acts of its employee. The criminal trial commenced in Jan 2012 with a decision at the first trial level rendered on January 25, 2016. Appeals have been filed and are pending . While Korea is a jurisdiction that does not differentiate between a felony and misdemeanor, the eventual punishment rendered against DSK in Jan 2016, a fine over $1000, now makes it clear that this event falls under the definition of a felony as provided in the Form BD definitions. DSK was convicted on 1/25/2016. DSK was subject to a criminal fine of KRW 1.5 Billion(Approx. USD 1.25M) and forfeiture of illegal profits. The prosecutor has filed an appeal and DSK has filed a counter-appeal. There is no final due date set for the criminal fine due to the pending appeals. DB and DSK have already disgorged the profits on the trading activities to the prosecutors. UPDATE: A criminal fine of KRW 1.5 billion (less than 2 million euros) was imposed on DSK. The criminal trial verdicts against both the DSK trader and against DSK were overturned on appeal in a decision rendered by the Seoul High Court in December 2018. The Korean Prosecutors Offices appeal of the Seoul High Court decision was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court of South Korea on December 21, 2023. In addition, a number of civil actions have been filed in Korean courts against Deutsche Bank and DSK by certain parties who allege they incurred losses as a consequence of the fall in the KOSPI 200. The one outstanding claim was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court of South Korea on December 21, 2023."	DSK was convicted on 1/25/2016.

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Oklahoma Securities Commission Rule 660:11-5-42 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Oklahoma Securities Commission Rule 660:11-5-42 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.

The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the ""Term Sheet""). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $37,407.91 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (""DBSI""): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities (""ARS""), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the stipulation and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Utah Code Ann. Section 61-1-6(2)(A)(II)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Utah Code Ann. Section 61-1-6(2)(A)(II)(J) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the stipulation and consent order entered by the Division on October 27, 2011, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $188,095.65 to the Utah Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The stipulation and consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the ""Term Sheet""). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $188,095.65 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the stipulation and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $188,095.65 to the Utah Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

On January 30, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") entered into a final notice under Principle 3 (Management and Control) and Senior Management Arrangements. Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R. R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C.

The findings indicated that the Firm failed to have adequate controls in place to prevent the transmission of erroneous orders, because (i) its limit order controls did not take into consideration wide spreads that are quoted at the market open and are not an accurate representation of the trading price of a security; (ii) its controls failed to prevent the entry of a large pre-open market order that resulted in the execution of orders far away from the normal trading price of the security; and (iii) the Firm used an incorrect process to adjudicate a transaction. Specifically, the findings stated that on December 3, 2013, the Firm sent a clearly erroneous filing to NASDAQ in PTC, Inc. When it entered an order at 9:30:00, which resulted in a 100-share execution at $2.21 when the previous close on that stock was $32.58 and the NASDAQ official opening print at that time, but after the Firm's trade, was $32.43. The findings state further that on December 23, 2014, trades occurred between 9:33:00 and 9:34:00, in which the Firm received an electronic buy order for 50,000 shares at market price, and the Firm's Smart Order Router sent high-priced limit orders to various exchanges. Finally, the findings stated that on December 3, 2014, the Firm sent a CE Filing to NASDAQ in market vectors gold miners ETF when trades occurred between 15:59:00 and 16:00:00 in which a 250,000-share sell market order fully executed at $17.72, but NASDAQ declined to act, advising that the CE Filing did not meet the parameters to justify breaking the trade. B. 20140417491: The findings stated that the Firm failed to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the regulatory risks in connection with its Direct Market Access (DMA) business because the firm failed to include a customer's DMA trading activity in its post-trade market abuse surveillance between March 1, 2014 and April 30, 2014, and, in doing so, failed to detect potential layering activity by this customer. C. 20140435497: the findings state that the Firm discovered and self-reported to FINRA that due to an error during a change in the Firm's internal systems, certain post-trade market abuse surveillance was not run on the firm's customer equity DMA business when utilizing two separate systems. The findings indicated that in transitioning to one system (a customer DMA platform with Smart Order Routing), the Firm failed to feed its DMA order data into the surveillance models. With only executed trades considered by the Firm's post-trade surveillance, potential manipulative order activity was not captured as part of the Firm's obligation to monitor for manipulation, fraud, and other illegal activity. The findings stated that the gap in post-trade market abuse surveillance occurred from July 1, 2012 through November 30, 2014 on one system, and from July 1, 2013, through December 31, 2014 on another. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. consented to the imposition of a censure and a fine in the amount of $225,000.00. Monetary fine of $225,000.00. The fine will be paid.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. consented to the imposition of a censure and a fine in the amount of $225,000.00.

(""KDI""); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls). DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

The findings state further that on December 23, 2014, trades occurred between 9:33:00 and 9:34:00, in which the Firm received an electronic buy order for 50,000 shares at market price, and the Firm's Smart Order Router sent high-priced limit orders to various exchanges.

Accordingly, as set forth more fully in the AWC, the firm has undertaken to add terms to its email review lexicon for client advisors, to review electronic communications of client advisors from January 1, 2012 to date using those additional terms, and to review its supervisory procedures for responding to ""red flags"" of potential misconduct by a client advisor relating to such personal financial difficulties.

Specifically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board found that (A) the most recent examination of the BSA/AML program at DBTCA and the New York branch conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified significant deficiencies in DBTCA's and the branch's risk management and compliance with BSA/AML requirements that resulted in a violation of the Regulatory Compliance Program requirement, and (B) deficiencies in DBTCA's transaction monitoring capabilities prevented DBTCA from properly assessing BSA/AML risk for billions of dollars in certain potentially suspicious transactions.

The Order also requires certain Deutsche Bank entities to submit several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, monitoring, and reporting functions.

On January 30, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") entered into a final notice under Principle 3 (Management and Control) and Senior Management Arrangements. Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $33,252.25 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the administrative consent order."

The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced. The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules. Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process.

FINRA alleged DBSI exceeded the relevant position limit in three different securities for five different customers (exceeding the relevant position limit in a range of between 7.9 percent and 120 percent) for between one and seven consecutive days during October 2011, January 2014, and November 2014, and January 2015 through February 2015. The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360 (B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period of February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360 (B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014).

FINRA alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (""DBSI"") failed to establish adequate supervisory procedures and systems for the outsourcing of communications with its customers about the sale of Vonage LLC securities in connection with Vonage's Directed Share Program, which was part of Vonage's initial public offering in May 2006. DBSI executed an AWC without admitting or denying FINRA's findings. FINRA found that DBSI, one of three lead underwriters for the May 24, 2006 initial public offering of the common stock of Vonage LLC, failed to establish supervisory procedures and systems reasonably designed to supervise the activities of a third party company to whom DBSI outsourced communications with DBSI's customers through a website developed by the third party company to administer Vonage's Directed Share Program. DBSI paid a $100,000 fine on October 6, 2009 as required. The AWC sets forth a timetable pursuant to which (1) FINRA will identify customers eligible for restitution, (2) DBSI will prepare notifications and certifications, and once approved by FINRA, will send such materials to eligible customers, (3) eligible customers may return executed certifications, and (4) DBSI will provide restitution to customers who timely return executed certifications. Further, DBSI is in the process of reviewing certain aspects of its supervisory policies and procedures, in accordance with the terms of the AWC. Within 150 days of issuance of the AWC, DBSI must certify that it has policies and procedures in place relating to outsourcing in connection with public offerings of common stock that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA rules, and provide a written description of such policies and procedures. Fine of $100,000 paid on October 6, 2009; restitution of no more than approximately $52,000 to no more than approximately 59 customers to be paid in accordance with procedures set forth in the AWC."

Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions.

The term sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $535,364.03 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedures for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."

The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid. ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007. On March 7, 2007, the ASX Issued a disciplinary circular naming DSAL and providing details of the offense and penalty imposed. A fine of a A$45,000 was imposed upon Deutsche Securities Australia Limited."	A fine of a A$45,000 was imposed upon Deutsche Securities Australia Limited.

The issues identified by the FCA related to the period May 2008 to November 2012 and included the following: 1) Investment restriction breaches in UK-domiciled retail funds managed by Invesco Perpetual. Such breaches had been identified by Invesco Perpetual and reported to FCA, and the Funds were promptly reimbursed where necessary. 2) Disclosures regarding the use of, and risks associated with, derivatives were not made or inadequately made in disclosure documents for two UK-domiciled retail funds managed by Invesco Perpetual. These disclosure failings were corrected in August 2012. 3) Invesco Perpetual failed to adequately document allocations of fixed income securities when aggregating client orders. A review by Invesco Perpetual determined there was no evidence that this impacted investors. 4) Certain fixed income transactions were not posted on a timely basis. This did not result in any need to re-price funds."	The Financial Conduct Authority imposed a financial penalty of GBP 18.6 million which is approximately $31.1 million.
