DBL internally identified and self reported to the FSA issues relating to both transactions. DBL appointed external advisors to undertake a detailed investigation into the transactions, the results of which were provided to the FSA in May 2004. The first transaction involved a book build in Scania AB, B shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 5, in that DBL had purchased high volumes of Scania AB, B shares using external brokers, rather than trading in DBL     s own name, thereby increasing and stabilizing the share price.

The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL     s internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI consented to the Commission making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. 70 P.S. Section 305(A)(IX) allows the Commission, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. 70 P.S. Section 305(A)(VII) allows the Commission, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order entered by the Commission on December 15, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $344,384.49 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $344,384.49 penalty imposed by the Commission is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $344,384.49 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/2008.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. W.S. Section 17-4-106(A)(II)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $79,325.84 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order assessing civil penalty and consent to entry of order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. ORS 59.205(2) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

The order assessing civil penalty and consent to entry of order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $40,298.80 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Docket No. 2009-07	08-APR-2010	Bureau of Securities of Dept. of Fin. of the State of Idaho ('The Department')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter:  Initiation date 4/8/2010.  The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Idaho Code Section 30-14-412(D)(13) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Idaho Code Section 30-14-412(D)(9) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on April 8, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Idaho Department of Finance and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Idaho Department of Finance and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 204(A)(2)(G) of Act No. 60 allows the Office, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 204(A)(2)(J) of Act No. 60 allows the Office, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to a consent order entered by the Office on December 4, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Secretary of the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.

(CGMI'), a control affiliate of Applicant. The order finds CGMI willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order finds that there were two distinct disclosure failures by CGMI in the offer and sale of mutual fund shares to its customers. First, CGMI did not adequately disclose its revenue sharing program whereby CGMI received from advisers and distributors associated with certain mutual fund complexes revenue sharing payments in exchange for which CGMI granted mutual funds access to, or increased visibility in, CGMI retail distribution network. Second, CGMI failed to disclose adequately at the point of sale, in connection with recommendations to customers to buy Class B shares, that such shares were subject to higher annual fees and that those fees could have a negative impact on the customers' investment returns depending on amount invested and the intended holding period. The Order censured CGMI, required that CGMI cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-10, and required that CGMI pay a $20 million civil money penalty.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order assessing civil penalty and consent to entry of order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. ORS 59.205(2) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. ORS 59.205(13) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the order assessing civil penalty and consent to entry of order entered by the Division on January 27, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $40,298.80 to the State of Oregon and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The order assessing civil penalty and consent to entry of order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $40,298.80 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 8-1103(9)(A)(VII) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $74,086.10 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C-1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct. On December 21, 2006 the SEC also issued an order under Rule 602(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., Deutsche Investment Management Americas, Inc., and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., granting a waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(C)(3).

Ch. 110A. section 204(A)(2)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 110A. section 204(A)(2)(J) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the administrative consent order entered by the Division on January 26, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $3,210,161.72 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The administrative consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $3,210,161.72 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The administrative consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $3,210,161.72 to the Division of Sec. and take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing CIBC consented to the entry of a Final Judgment permanently enjoining CIBC from violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule l0b-5 there under, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 there under, Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, Rule 13b2-1, and Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. This Final Judgment was also filed on December 22, 2003. On the same day CIBC deposited with the Court $80,000,000 in disgorgement, interest and a civil penalty. In addition to these sanctions CIBC also agreed that it will not seek any benefit from any offset or reduction of any investor's claim, and that it shall not seek reimbursement or indemnification, nor any tax deduction or credit for any of the amount paid. The SEC has agreed to not institute any proceedings against CIBC, its subsidiaries or affiliates pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B, 15C, or 19(h) of the Exchange Act.

In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10B(1) and 10C(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent. See item (v) above for detail.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings.

ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.

('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Oklahoma Securities Commission Rule 660:11-5-42 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Oklahoma Securities Commission Rule 660:11-5-42 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on February 1, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $37,407.91 to the Oklahoma Securities Department and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $37,407.91 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $37,407.91 to the Oklahoma Securities Department and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.
