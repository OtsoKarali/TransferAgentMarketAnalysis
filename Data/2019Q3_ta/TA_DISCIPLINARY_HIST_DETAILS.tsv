0000849542-19-000009	violationOfRegulations	8	The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon)	SEC Release No. 33-10856; Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-18933	17-DEC-2018	"Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"")"	"This action arises out of the SEC's assertion that BNY Mellon, as depositary bank, engaged in improper practices in connection with the pre-release of American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs""). Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	on 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking & Securities division business, (1)its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers to inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) it AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective systems for monitoring money flows associated with transactions; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant to which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rules into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Laws 44 and 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R.R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C.

Although the FED acknowledged that the Bank ""fully cooperated"" with the FED and ""has made and continues to make progress in implementing enhancements to its firm-wide compliance systems and controls"", the FED found that during the review period from October 2008 through October 2013, the Bank lacked adequate governance, risk management, compliance and audit policies and procedures to ensure that the Bank's foreign exchange activities complied with safe and sound banking practices and applicable internal policies, which prevented the Bank from detecting and addressing unsafe and unsound conduct by certain of its FX traders. As a result of this conduct, the FED found that the Bank engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Bank consented to the entry of the Order on April 20, 2017 by the FED, pursuant to which the Bank: (A) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $136,950,000, which the Bank paid on April 20, 2017; and (B) shall submit written plans to improve senior management oversight and the compliance risk management program, an enhanced written internal controls and compliance program, and an enhanced written internal audit program to the FED within 90 days of the Order; (C) shall conduct periodic monitoring by senior management, an annual review of compliance policies and procedures and their implementation and an appropriate risk-focused sampling of other key controls, and a firm-wide risk assessment to evaluate current potential conduct risks; (D) for subsections B&C, shall adopt and promptly implement the approved plans and programs within 10 days of approval by the FED and thereafter fully comply with them; and (E) shall submit quarterly written progress reports to the FED. The Order requires the Bank to implement improvements in its oversight, internal controls, risk management, and audit programs, and to conduct an annual review of compliance policies and procedures and a risk-focused sampling of other key controls. The Bank must submit to the FED written progress reports on a quarterly basis detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the Order and the results thereof. The Order required the Bank to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $136,950,000, which the Bank paid on April 20, 2017."

FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume.

FINRA alleged DBSI exceeded the relevant position limit in three different securities for five different customers (exceeding the relevant position limit in a range of between 7.9 percent and 120 percent) for between one and seven consecutive days during October 2011, January 2014, November 2014, and January 2015 through February 2015. The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report its OCEND in one symbol. The findings also stated that the Firm failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for acting in concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period after February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360(B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014).

In addition, the findings state that DBSI submitted inaccurate reports to the LOPR, in that the Firm entered incorrect data in the ""Effective Date"" field due to errors involving the Firm's third-party vendor's processing of certain trades.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA)	20-MAY-2014	Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA)	Inconsistency in the accounting of Merrill Lynch Yatirim Bank A.S.s FX swap (FX roll) transactions according to the BRSAs Banking Law No. 5411 article 39 and regulation on local chart of accounts article 9. BRSA informed Merrill Lynch Yatirim Bank A.S. (MLYB) that there was an inconsistency between the local Chart of Accounts (CoA) descriptions versus MLYBs FX swaps (FX roll) transaction bookings for the short leg of these trades which did not have same day maturity with the trade date. The concern was related with the account under which the short leg of the FX swap (FX roll) transactions which had maturities longer than trade date (T) were being booked. Though MLYB had been booking these trades under Derivatives main account, BRSA stated that only the long leg needs to be booked under Derivatives main account and the short leg needs to be booked under Other Liabilities account within the off balance sheet.

While offering the sell orders MLCE allegedly bought larger quantities in the over-the-counter market and paid the same price as the price of its sell orders. The Exchange found that the sell orders gave or were likely to give misleading signals as to the supply and price of the Exchange product, and that the sell orders most likely were offered with intent to improperly influence the trading of other market participants. The Exchange therefore determined that MLCE violated the prohibition against market manipulation set out in the Market Conduct Rules, section 5.1. The Exchange further deemed it to be mitigating that the potential benefit from the manipulative activity was limited.	USD$57,329.02 (NOK350.000) Monetary/Fine

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Commissioner making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. LSA-R.S. 51:712A(2) allows the Commissioner to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. LSA-R.S. 51:712A allows the Commissioner to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Commissioner on June 7, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Louisiana Commissioner of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the ""Term Sheet""). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Commissioner is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the Louisiana Comm. of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Specifically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board found that (A) the most recent examination of the BSA/AML program at DBTCA and the New York branch conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified significant deficiencies in DBTCA's and the branch's risk management and compliance with BSA/AML requirements that resulted in a violation of the Regulatory Compliance Program requirement, and (B) deficiencies in DBTCA's transaction monitoring capabilities prevented DBTCA from properly assessing BSA/AML risk for billions of dollars in certain potentially suspicious transactions.

These obligations have various due dates beginning 30 days after the Order was signed. The Order imposes affirmative obligations including the retention of independent third parties to review DBTCA's compliance with applicable BSA/AML requirements and to conduct a transaction review of DBTCA's foreign correspondent banking activity from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The Order also requires certain Deutsche Bank entities to submit several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, monitoring, and reporting functions. The Order required DBAG to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $41 million, which the Firm paid on June 6, 2017.

On January 30, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") entered into a final notice under Principle 3 (Management and Control) and Senior Management Arrangements. Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R. R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C. DBAG and DBAG's New York branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York branch: (a) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017; and (b) engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing Bank Secrecy Act (""BSA"")/ Anti-Money Laundering (""AML"") compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York branch recommend corrective actions, and oversee the implementation of corrective actions the DFS deems necessary.

The independent monitor must submit to DBAG a written report on its findings and recommendations. Sixty days thereafter, DBAG must submit to the DFS a written action plan to improve and enhance its BSA/AML compliance programs, after which the DFS will determine which recommendations DBAG should implement. The independent monitor will thereafter oversee the implementation of the recommendations, assess DBAG's compliance with the corrective measures, and submit additional reports or recommendations as necessary.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls). DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015. DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00. The fine was paid on June 9, 2015."	DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00. The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.

CFTC alleged that DBAG failed to properly report cancellations of SWAP transactions in all asset classes, which in the aggregate included between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of reporting violations and errors and omissions in its SWAP reporting. CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014. CFTC alleged that, because of DBAG's reporting failures, misinformation was disseminated to the market through real time public tape and to the CFTC. CFTC alleged that DBAG's reporting failures resulted in part due to deficiencies with its SWAPS supervisory system. CFTC alleged that DBAG did not have an adequate system to supervise all activities related to Compliance with the SWAPS reporting requirements until at least sometime between April and July of 2014. DBAG agreed to pay a 2.5 million civil monetary penalty and comply with undertakings to improve its internal controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of its SWAPS reporting.

Specifically, the SEC Staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number of foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (i) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNYMellon in which BNYMellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil money penalty of $20.5 million.

While offering the sell orders MLCE allegedly bought larger quantities in the over-the-counter market and paid the same price as the price of its sell orders. The Exchange found that the sell orders gave or were likely to give misleading signals as to the supply and price of the Exchange product, and that the sell orders most likely were offered with intent to improperly influence the trading of other market participants. The Exchange therefore determined that MLCE violated the prohibition against market manipulation set out in the Market Conduct Rules, section 5.1. The Exchange further deemed it to be mitigating that the potential benefit from the manipulative activity was limited.	USD$57,329.02 (NOK350.000) Monetary/Fine

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	on 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.
