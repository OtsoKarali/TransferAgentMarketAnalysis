The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with than investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

(INVESCO)	Docket #03-CV-2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds? prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long-term investments in certain non-timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds? prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors? consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding: The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured; ordered to cease and desist; and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(D) and 34(B) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D-1, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US$215 Million. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US$110 Million. A I M Advisors, as successor adviser to INVESCO Funds Group, agreed to pay the penalty and disgorgement amounts ordered against INVESCO Funds Group on the following dates: US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2004, and the remaining US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2005. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US$235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market-timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including: maintaining a board of trustees that is 75% independent; designating an independent Chairman of the Board; maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees; holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years; cooperating fully with the SEC; maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman; retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant; conducting periodic compliance reviews; and retaining an independent distribution consultant.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

0000893220-07-003674	sraViolationOfRules	1	Anthem Securites	Letter of Caution	30-JAN-2007	National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the 'NASD')	Anthem Securities, Inc. (Anthem Securities'), a Pennsylvania corporation, is a 'control affiliate' of the Registrant as defined in item 3, because Anthem Securities currently is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of AIC, Inc., which is also the direct parent company of the Registrant as set forth in our response to Item 2(a) above. Thus, Anthem Securities and the Registrant are under 'common control.' Anthem Securities also is registered with the SEC as a broker/dealer firm and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the 'NASD'). Following a 'Routine Examination' of Anthem Securities conducted by the NASD from August 15,thru September 2, 2005 the NASD issued a 'Letter of Caution' dated January 30, 2006 to Anthem Securities. This Letter of Caution stated that the NASD 'found general compliance with the Rules and Regulation reviewed,' but not the following deficiencies: Anthem Securities did not document in writing the attendance of all of it's registered employees at it's annual compliance meetings from 2001 to 2004: the bank serving as escrow agent for an offering in which Anthem Securities participated as dealer-manager of the offering made a prohibited investment of the escrowed subscription funds in a money market mutual fund, although no subscription funds were lost as a result; Anthem Securities' 'Checks Received and Forwarded' blotter did not include the check forwarded date for 20 checks in an offering in which Anthem Securities participated as dealer-manager of the offering, although all 20 checks were otherwise properly forwarded. The Letter of Caution required Anthem Securities to provide to the NASD a detailed description of the steps it would take to correct the deficiencies described above, which Anthem Securities did, and the deficiencies noted above are now resolved.	Finally, the Letter of Caution does not name any individuals, and it states that the Letter of Caution is not included in the Control Registration Depository (CRD), not must it be reported on Anthem Securities' Form BD or Form U-4.

The SEC issued an ?Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.?  In the Order, the SEC alleged that from July 2000 through June 2004, The Dreyfus Corporation (?Dreyfus?) collected compensation from Dreyfus Premier Enterprise Fund and Dreyfus Premier Nextech Fund (each, a ?Fund,? together, the ?Funds?) in violation of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that during the relevant period, Dreyfus charged performance-based compensation that was calculated for each of the two Funds by applying its total fee rate (comprised of a fulcrum-fee rate as adjusted by a performance-adjustment rate) against each Fund?s daily net asset value, and, thus, Dreyfus did not calculate its total fee consistent with either Rule 205-2(b) or Rule 205-2(c).  Upon notification by the SEC that Dreyfus was charging a total fee based on a method that did not comply with Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Dreyfus discontinued the method and subsequently reimbursed the Funds plus interest of $273,830, for a total payment of $3,270,025.  In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Dreyfus submitted an Offer of Settlement which the SEC determined to accept.  The SEC ordered the sanctions agreed to in the Offer of Settlement ? namely, that Dreyfus is censured and that Dreyfus cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Section 205(a) of the Advisers Act.  In determining to accept the Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Dreyfus and the cooperation afforded the Commission staff.	Order issued on consent.
