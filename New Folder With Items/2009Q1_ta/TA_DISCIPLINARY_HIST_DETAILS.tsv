Johnson	Docket Case Number 3 10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter. Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company (KSvC), Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. (KDI); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (Scudder Kemper): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (Scudder Kemper), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Order), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with than investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

(INVESCO)	Docket #03-CV-2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds' prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long-term investments in certain non-timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds' prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors' consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding: The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured; ordered to cease and desist; and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(D) and 34(B) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D-1, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US$215 Million. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US$110 Million. Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. (formerly, A I M Advisors), as successor adviser to INVESCO Funds Group, agreed to pay the penalty and disgorgement amounts ordered against INVESCO Funds Group on the following dates: US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2004, and the remaining US$162.5 Million by December 31, 2005. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US$235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market-timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including: maintaining a board of trustees that is 75% independent; designating an independent Chairman of the Board; maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees; holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years; cooperating fully with the SEC; maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman; retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant; conducting periodic compliance reviews; and retaining an independent distribution consultant.	SEC proceeding settled Oct 8, 2004.

The clients of a registered representative deposited stock certificates that did not contain any restrictions on resale or transfer according to the transfer agent. The registered representative was in possession of a legal opinion addressing the origin and resale of the issuer's shares.

0001455353-09-000003	subjectOfProceedings	1	Frank Brickell	Complaint	31-MAR-2008	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)	FINRA's Department of Enforcement is alleging that activities of three clients of World Trade Financial Corporation violated section 5 of the securities act and Frank Edward Brickell, as the registered representative, violated Conduct Rule 2110 by selling unregistered stock without an applicable exemption from registration. The shares deposited with the registered representative did not contain any restrictions on resale or transfer according to the transfer agent who was in possession of a legal opinion addressing the available of an exemption to registration. Enforcement has argued that the representative and the firm had a heighted responsibility to conduct a further inquiry as to the resale of these shares. The case also involves additional broker dealers, registered representatives, and shareholders who are claimed to have participated in an unregistered distribution. The shareholders and the issuer's officers appear to have knowingly orchestrated a distribution. World Trade Financial Corporation, its supervisors, and the registered representative did not knowingly participate in the alleged distribution. At the commencement of the hearing it was argued that distribution did occur, but there was lack of evidence that an illegal distribution occurred. The underlying premise is whether World Trade Financial Corporation had a heightened responsibility to conduct further inquires concerning the resale of the securities.	Hearing ended November 13, 2008, awaiting panel decision.

0000944496-09-000002	enjoinedInvestmentRelatedActivity	1	CIBC Mellon Trust Company	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. CIBC Mellon Trust Company	14-JAN-2005	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC')	CIBC Mellon Trust Company ('CMTC'), a transfer agent that is an affiliate of Registrant by virtue of Mellon Canada Holding Company's 50 percent interest in the joint venture, submitted a Consent to Entry of Judgment (the 'Consent') which was presented by the SEC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the 'Court) on February 16, 2005. In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC )the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10(b)(1) and 10(c)(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent. See item (v) above for detail.

NASD Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent	22-MAR-2005	National Association of Security Dealers - NASD (nka FINRA)	On March 22, 2005 the NASD accepted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent dated March 18, 2005 (the 'AWC') submitted by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ('CGMI'), a control affiliate of Registrant. Without admitting or denying the findings, CGMI accepted and consented, prior to a hearing and without an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of findings by NASD. In particular, NASD found that, in connection with its sale of Class B and Class C mutual fund shares to its customers, CGMI, through its registered representatives, known as financial consultants ('FCs'), either did not adequately disclose at the point of sale, or did not adequately consider in connection with its recommendations to customers to purchase Class B and Class C shares, the differences in share classes and that an equal investment in Class A shares would generally have been more advantageous for the customers. NASD further found that CGMI's supervisory and compliance policies and procedures were not reasonably designed to ensure that FC's consistently provided adequate disclosure or, or consideration to, the benefits of the various share classes as they applied to individual customers. As a result of such conduct, NASD found that CGMI had violated NASD Conduct Rules 2110, 2310, and 3010. Based on its findings and with CGMI's consent, NASD, censured CGMI and fined it $6.25 million. In the AWC, CGMI also agreed to complete certain undertakings, including retaining an Independent Consultant, among other things, to conduct a comprehensive review of the completeness of its disclosures regarding the differences in mutual fund share classes and the policies and procedures relating to CGMI's recommendations to its customers of different class shares of mutual funds.

SEC Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Order	23-MAR-2005	Securities and Exchange Commission	On March 23, 2005 the SEC entered an administrative and cease-and-desist order against Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI'), a control affiliate of Applicant. The order finds CGMI willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order finds that there were two distinct disclosure failures by CGMI in the offer and sale of mutual fund shares to its customers. First, CGMI did not adequately disclose its revenue sharing program whereby CGMI received from advisers and distributors associated with certain mutual fund complexes revenue sharing payments in exchange for which CGMI granted mutual funds access to, or increased visibility in, CGMI retail distribution network. Second, CGMI failed to disclose adequately at the point of sale, in connection with recommendations to customers to buy Class B shares, that such shares were subject to higher annual fees and that those fees could have a negative impact on the customers' investment returns depending on amount invested and the intended holding period. The Order censured CGMI, required that CGMI cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-10, and required that CGMI pay a $20 million civil money penalty.

0001018490-09-000002	violationOfRegulations	6	Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant, and Gary P. Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

0000842657-09-000002	foreignAgency	1	Deutsche Securities Australia Limited, a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Occurrence 1347474	24-JAN-2007	Australian Securities Exchange	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: The Australian Securities Exchange (     ASX     ) determined that Deutsche Securities Australia Limited (     DSAL     ) contravened ASX Market Rule 20.8.3 as a result of executing five special crossings in derivative market contracts over a cash market product for which there was a current offer period for a takeover bid and contravened ASX Market Rule 20.8.4 by executing one special crossing in a combination when a component part of the combination was a derivatives market contract over a cash market product for which there was a current offer period for a takeover bid. The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted (     DSAL     ) on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid.
