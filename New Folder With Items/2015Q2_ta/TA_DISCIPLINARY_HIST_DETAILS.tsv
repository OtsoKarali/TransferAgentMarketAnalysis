('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Order No. S-09-024-09-CO07	13-JAN-2010	Department of Securities of the State of Arkansas ('The Department')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 1/13/2010. The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Ark. Code Ann. section 23-42-308(A)(2)(G) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Ark. Code Ann. section 23-42-308(A)(2)(J) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on January 13, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $35,781.78 ($3,578.17 to the Arkansas State Fund at the Investor Protection Trust and $32,203.61 to the Department) and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $35,781.78 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $35,781.78 and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $827,886.15 penalty imposed by the Board is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. W.S. Section 17-4-106(A)(II)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. W.S. Section 17-4-106(B)(II) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on April 9, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $79,325.84 to the Wyoming Secretary of State and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $79,325.84 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The Consent Order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a Term Sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $199,478.53 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The Consent Order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the Consent Order.

Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010.

The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

CIBC Mellon Trust Company	14-JAN-2005	U.S Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC')	CIBC Mellon Trust Company ('CMTC'), a transfer agent that is an affiliate of Registrant by virtue of Mellon Canada Holding Company's 50 percent interest in the joint venture, submitted a Consent to Entry of Judgment (the 'Consent'), which was presented by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the 'Court') on February 16, 2005. In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on Feb. 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10B(1) and 10C(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent.  See item (v) above for detail.

The SEC alleged that the registrant, in its capacity as fund administrator to certain series formed under the trusts, failed to ensure that certain shareholder reports contained adequate disclosure of the process by which the trustees evaluated the terms of certain advisory contracts entered into by the trusts and, in doing so, violated Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 30(e)(1) promulgated thereunder. The SEC also alleged that the registrant failed to ensure that certain series of the trusts maintained and preserved copies of written materials that the trustees considered in reviewing and approving certain advisory contracts in violation of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2(a)(6) promulgated thereunder.	In settlement, registrant agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations, pay a $50,000 fine, and hire an independent consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

The SEC alleged that, on certain occasions during the relevant period, disclosures included in shareholder reports concerning the trustees' evaluation process with respect to certain advisory contracts entered into by certain series of the trusts contained boilerplate disclosures that were materially untrue or misleading in violation of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because such disclosures were made based on board minutes reviewed and approved by the trustees, the SEC deemed the violations to have been caused by the trustees. Also during the relevant period, the SEC deemed that the trustees were a cause of certain series' violations of Rule 38a-1(a)(1) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires registered investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the trustees failed to implement those series' policies and procedures to the extent they required the series' chief compliance officer to provide the adviser's compliance manuals to the trustees for their review, or as an alternative, summaries of the compliance programs upon which the trustees could rely in approving the compliance manuals of the series' new advisers.	Mr. Miola agreed to cease and desist from committing any future violations and hire an independent compliance consultant to review the compliance program relating to the trusts.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $44,454.46 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $468,512.16 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998.

On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

The NASD alleged that DBSI violated NASD conduct rule 2110 in connection with the firm's allocation and sale of initial public offerings ('IPOS') from September 1999 through March 2000.  The NASD found that DBSI received without inquiry $4.81 million in unusually high agency commissions on listed agency trades from 10 customers within one day of allocating IPO shares to such customers.  The firm received commissions set by these customers of up to $1 per share to execute institutional sized agency trades in listed securities.  By receiving these payments from certain customers without inquiry while providing the customers with IPO allocations the NASD found that, the firm failed to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade, in violation of NASD Conduct Rule 2110.  DBSI neither admitted nor denied the NASD's findings.  The current status is: closed on May 18, 2004. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent, consenting to a censure, a fine in the amount of $481,000, and disgorgement of $4,810,000, both of which were paid on May 20, 2004.

The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS') and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (i) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (ii) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (iii) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business, in violation of section 8.E(1)(b) of the Illinois Securities Act ('Act'); and (2) in connection with the failure to (i) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS; (ii) create and maintain adequate supervisory procedures concerning ARS; (iii) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents; and (iv) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct, in violation of its duties under section 8.E(1)(e)(i) of the act. The activities cited in the consent order are grounds, pursuant to the act, for the initiation of administrative proceedings, and, pursuant to the act, to impose such other remedial measures as may be necessary in the public interest. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on July 16, 2012, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $535,364.03 to the Illinois Secretary of State and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in august 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA that resulted in a term sheet (the 'term sheet'). The term sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $535,364.03 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedures for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Dept., without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $535,364.03 and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before Feb. 13, 2008.

Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on March 10, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $51,862.37 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $51,862.37 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

The Commission alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI consented to the Commission making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. 70 P.S. Section 305(A)(IX) allows the Commission, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. 70 P.S. Section 305(A)(VII) allows the Commission, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order entered by the Commission on December 15, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $344,384.49 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $344,384.49 penalty imposed by the Commission is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $344,384.49 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/2008.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The order assessing civil penalty and consent to entry of order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $40,298.80 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.	Without admitting or denying the findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented to FINRA's findings, a censure, a fine of $1.25 mil. and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory proced. relating to adver. trade vol.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ('DBSI' or 'firm') trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.	Without admitting or denying the findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented to FINRA's findings, a censure, a fine of $1.25 mil. and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory proced. relating to adver. trade vol.

('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Auction Rate Securities	05-MAR-2010	Department of Banking and Finance of the State of Nebraska ('The Department')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 3/5/2010. The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 8-1103(9)(A)(VII) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 8-1103(9)(A)(XI) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order entered by the Department on March 5, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $74,086.10 to the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $74,086.10 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $74,086.10 to the Nebraska Dept. of Banking and Fin. and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

NMSA Section 58-13B-16A(2)(H) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

Off. of the Attny Gen. of the St. of So. Carolina ('The Division')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter:  Initiation date 3/11/2010.  The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the administrative consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. The South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. The South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the administrative consent order entered by the Division on March 11, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $33,252.25 to the Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.

The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Amended filing date: 12/21/2006. On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') in connection with DBSI's alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C-1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct. On December 21, 2006 the SEC also issued an order under Rule 602(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., Deutsche Investment Management Americas, Inc., and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., granting a waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(C)(3). Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations or findings, DBSI agreed to total payment of $442,954, consisting of $202,835 in disgorgement, $202,835 in civil penalty, and $37,284 in prejudgment interest.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid.

ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007.

The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.

DB London was able to produce documentation sufficient to attest that it was engaged in market sounding which is permitted under AMF Rules. However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations.
