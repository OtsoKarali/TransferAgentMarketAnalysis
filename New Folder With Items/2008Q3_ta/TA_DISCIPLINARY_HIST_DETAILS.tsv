The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on the basis of information communicated by DB London before the issuance of the bonds was publicly announced, during its market sounding activities.  The AMF concluded that DB had no culpability in relation to alleged insider dealing activities, but alleged procedural, record keeping omissions by DB, in relation to the records it maintained of the market soundings.  On December 22, 2006, the AMF notified DB London that it would be sanctioned for technical and procedural violations in connection with a convertible bond offering by Alcatel, DB lead managed the transaction.  There was no case to answer for insider trading. DB London conducted market soundings with several hedge funds ahead of the offering in December 2002.

However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations. AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.	AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.

(INVESCO)	Docket #03-CV-2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds? prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long-term investments in certain non-timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds? prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors? consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding: The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured; ordered to cease and desist; and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, Sections 17(D) and 34(B) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D-1, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US$215 Million. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US$110 Million. Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc.

INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US$235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market-timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including: maintaining a board of trustees that is 75% independent; designating an independent Chairman of the Board; maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees; holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years; cooperating fully with the SEC; maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman; retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant; conducting periodic compliance reviews; and retaining an independent distribution consultant.

On December 22, 2003 the SEC filed a Complaint with the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas alleging that CIBC aided and abetted violations of the federal securities laws related to certain structured finance transactions between CIBC and the Enron Corporation including Enron?s manipulation of its reported financial results through a series of financial transactions that were improperly reported by Enron as asset sales; that CIBC knew or was reckless in not knowing that loans were structured as asset sales for accounting and financial reporting purposes and therefore CIBC knowingly and substantially assisted Enron to file with the SEC false and misleading reports and failed to make and keep accurate books, records and accounts.

In addition to these sanctions CIBC also agreed that it will not seek any benefit from any offset or reduction of any investor?s claim, and that it shall not seek reimbursement or indemnification, nor any tax deduction or credit for any of the amount paid. The SEC has agreed to not institute any proceedings against CIBC, its subsidiaries or affiliates pursuant to Sections 15(b), 15B, 15C, or 19(h) of the Exchange Act.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL?s internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.   The current status is closed on 4/11/2006.  For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions.  This fine was paid to the FSA on 13 April 2006.  DBL agreed to pay: (i) a fine of GBP 3,500,000, and a 'loss avoidance' figure of  GBP 2,363,643 with respect to the Scania transaction due to the DBL purchases and the inaccurate coverage statements (ii) a fine of GBP 500,000 with respect to the Cytos Biotechnolgy transaction for failure to follow internal procedures on stabilization, and failure to escalate issue to Compliance in a timely manner.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with than investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.  The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On December 21, 2006 the NYSE instituted and settled a disciplinary proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (?DBSI?) in connection with DBSI?s alleged violations of NYSE Rules 401 and 476(A)(6) for failure to adhere to principles of good business practice and engaging in conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade in connection with having violated Rule 22C-1, as adopted under section 22(C) of the investment company act of 1940. The NYSE alleged that DBSI violated the above cited Rules by the conduct of a DBSI former registered representative who entered late trades for at least one customer. More specifically, the NYSE alleged that the registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares after 4:00 P.M. Eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The NYSE further alleged that DBSI violated NYSE Rule 342 by failing to reasonably supervise the registered representative and failing to establish and maintain appropriate procedures for supervision and control effective to detect and prevent the registered representative?s deceptive customer trading of mutual funds. DBSI, without admitting or denying the allegations or findings, consented to censure and total payment of $442,954.  In view of the above findings the NYSE imposed the penalty consented to by DBSI of a censure and a total payment in the amount of $442,954.  Payment of the $442,954 by DBSI pursuant to an order issued in a related SEC proceeding against DBSI shall be deemed payment in satisfaction of the NYSE stipulation and consent.

The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Amended filing date: 12/21/2006. On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (?DBSI?) in connection with DBSI?s alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C-1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M.  The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct.

As a result BNY entered into agreement to offer payment to certain security holders for property escheated erroneously (while reserving the right to pursue their claim for repayment with the State to which the property was escheated). . In addition BNY paid a penalty of $250,000 and agreed to the retention of an independent consultant to review and evaluate certain of the Bank?s policies and procedures.	See 10 (c) (2) (v) above

In certain instances, this conduct also affected the rate paid on the auction rate securities. As a result, BNY caused violations of section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. BNY was required to make certain disclosures regarding its material auction practices and procedures; and not later than 6 months after the date of this order, unless otherwise extended by the Staff of the Commission for good cause shown, have its CEO or general counsel certify in writing to the Staff of the Commission that BNY has implemented procedures. In addition BNY paid a monetary settlement in the amount of $750,000.	See 10(c)(2)(v) above

The respective EDNY and SDNY investigations related to actions by Bank employees that facilitated a fraudulent scheme conducted by RW Professional Leasing Services Corp., a former customer of one of the Bank?s Long Island branch offices, and certain funds transfer activities to and from Russia from 1996 to1999. Among other things, the non-prosecution agreement outlines a series of measures, many of which already are completed and others that are well underway, to enhance the Bank?s procedures for monitoring and reporting suspicious activity. The Bank has agreed to pay restitution and forfeiture totaling $38 million, all of which has been previously reserved. The agreement, which has a term of three years, provides for the Bank to retain an independent examiner to review the enhanced procedures and report to the government on a periodic basis.

CIBC Mellon Trust Company	14-JAN-2005	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (?SEC?)	CIBC Mellon Trust Company (?CMTC?), a transfer agent that is an affiliate of Registrant by virtue of Mellon Canada Holding Company?s 50 percent interest in the joint venture, submitted a Consent to Entry of Judgment (the ?Consent?) which was presented by the SEC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the ?Court?) on February 16, 2005. In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC?s investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the ?Final Judgment?) without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued ?legend free? stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company?s officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint?s allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the ?Order?). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10(b)(1) and 10(c)(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent. See item (v) above for detail.

The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.
