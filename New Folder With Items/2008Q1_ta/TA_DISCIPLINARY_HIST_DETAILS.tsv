0001018490-08-000003	foreignAgency	4	Deutsche Bank AG (London Branch) ('DBL'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Docket/Case Number: FSA/PN/036/006	11-APR-2006	The Financial Services Authority ('FSA')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: The Financial Services Authority (?FSA?) fined DBL for breaches of FSA Principle 5 (duty to observe proper standards of market conduct) and breaches of Principle 2 (duty to act with due skill, care and diligence) regarding two separate equity capital market transactions conducted by DBL in March 2004. DBL internally identified and self reported to the FSA issues relating to both transactions. DBL appointed external advisors to undertake a detailed investigation into the transactions, the results of which were provided to the FSA in May 2004. The first transaction involved a book build in Scania AB, B shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 5, in that DBL had purchased high volumes of Scania AB, B shares using external brokers, rather than trading in DBL?s own name, thereby increasing and stabilizing the share price. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL?s internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner.   The current status is closed on 4/11/2006.  For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions.  This fine was paid to the FSA on 13 April 2006.  DBL agreed to pay: (i) a fine of GBP 3,500,000, and a 'loss avoidance' figure of  GBP 2,363,643 with respect to the Scania transaction due to the DBL purchases and the inaccurate coverage statements (ii) a fine of GBP 500,000 with respect to the Cytos Biotechnolgy transaction for failure to follow internal procedures on stabilization, and failure to escalate issue to Compliance in a timely manner.	For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on the basis of information communicated by DB London before the issuance of the bonds was publicly announced, during its market sounding activities.  The AMF concluded that DB had no culpability in relation to alleged insider dealing activities, but alleged procedural, record keeping omissions by DB, in relation to the records it maintained of the market soundings.  On December 22, 2006, the AMF notified DB London that it would be sanctioned for technical and procedural violations in connection with a convertible bond offering by Alcatel, DB lead managed the transaction.  There was no case to answer for insider trading. DB London conducted market soundings with several hedge funds ahead of the offering in December 2002. DB London was able to produce documentation sufficient to attest that it was engaged in market sounding which is permitted under AMF Rules. However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations. AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.	AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

(?DBSI?) in connection with DBSI?s alleged violations of NYSE Rules 401 and 476(A)(6) for failure to adhere to principles of good business practice and engaging in conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade in connection with having violated Rule 22C-1, as adopted under section 22(C) of the investment company act of 1940. The NYSE alleged that DBSI violated the above cited Rules by the conduct of a DBSI former registered representative who entered late trades for at least one customer. More specifically, the NYSE alleged that the registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares after 4:00 P.M. Eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The NYSE further alleged that DBSI violated NYSE Rule 342 by failing to reasonably supervise the registered representative and failing to establish and maintain appropriate procedures for supervision and control effective to detect and prevent the registered representative?s deceptive customer trading of mutual funds. DBSI, without admitting or denying the allegations or findings, consented to censure and total payment of $442,954.  In view of the above findings the NYSE imposed the penalty consented to by DBSI of a censure and a total payment in the amount of $442,954.  Payment of the $442,954 by DBSI pursuant to an order issued in a related SEC proceeding against DBSI shall be deemed payment in satisfaction of the NYSE stipulation and consent.	DBSI, without admitting or denying the allegations or findings, consented to censure and total payment of $442,954.

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid.
