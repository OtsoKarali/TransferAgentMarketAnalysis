The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $827,886.15 penalty imposed by the Board is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.

INVESCO	Docket 03CV2421	02-DEC-2003	United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC	INVESCO Funds Group entered into over 40 negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements that were inconsistent with the INVESCO Funds prospectus disclosure limiting exchanges to 4 per 12 month period. Some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make long term investments in certain non timed INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group also tolerated marketing timing activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group typically did not take action to restrict shareholders trading in excess of the 4 exchange limit set in the INVESCO Funds prospectuses. Frequent trading by these shareholders resulted in substantial dilution in the affected INVESCO Funds. INVESCO Funds Group breached its fiduciary duty to INVESCO Funds and their shareholders by failing to disclose the conflict of interest raised by market timing agreements to the directors of the INVESCO Funds or to the INVESCO Fund shareholders, and by failing to obtain the directors consent to the timing agreements. INVESCO Funds Group financially benefited from the timing agreements. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement INVESCO Funds Group neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The disposition of the proceeding The SEC proceeding was settled on October 8, 2004. INVESCO Funds Group was censured ordered to cease and desist and is subject to remedial sanctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 206 1 and 206 2 of the Advisers Act, Sections 17 D and 34 B of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17D1, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of US 215 Million. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of US 110 Million. Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. formerly A I M Advisors as successor adviser to INVESCO Funds Group agreed to pay the penalty and disgorgement amounts ordered against INVESCO Funds Group on the following dates US 162.5 Million by December 31, 2004, and the remaining US 162.5 Million by December 31, 2005. INVESCO Funds Group was ordered to disgorge any amounts in excess of US 235 Million that it or its affiliates obtain through settlements based on market timing allegations. INVESCO Funds Group voluntarily undertook remedial actions, including maintaining a board of trustees that is 75 percent independent designating an independent Chairman of the Board maintaining independent legal counsel for the independent Trustees holding elections of Trustees at least every 5 years cooperating fully with the SEC maintaining a compliance and ethics oversight structure with an Internal Controls Committee and Ombudsman retaining an Independent Compliance Consultant conducting periodic compliance reviews and retaining an independent distribution consultant.

0000896852-11-000011	sraViolationOfRules	4	Van Kampen Funds Inc.	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange IKE of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price which was NAV minus 1 percent, and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10.00 per shareholder. Van Kampen engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in Van Kampen establishing a reserve of 300,000 against which any restitution and penalty will be charged. It is expected that all affected accounts will be reimbursed by the end of 2010. The disposition of the proceeding On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen accepted and consented, without admitting to or denying the FINRA finding of a violation of NASD Rule 2110. The findings state Van Kampen did not inform investors purchasing UITs through its In Kind Exchange programs the manner in which a discounted sales charge would be assessed, and investors could have concluded from the disclosures made that they were eligible to receive certain sales charge discounts when, in fact, such discounts did not apply to the In Kind Exchange programs. The firm has remediated approximately 4,600 customers who paid more than the exchange discount described in the prospectus approximately 200,000 including interest and prospectuses were updated to disclose the In Kind Exchange discount fully and accurately. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.	On January 24, 2011, Van Kampen entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent settlement with FINRA. Van Kampen also consented to the imposition of a censure and a 150,000 fine as settlement with FINRA.

The order finds CGMI willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order finds that there were two distinct disclosure failures by CGMI in the offer and sale of mutual fund shares to its customers. First, CGMI did not adequately disclose its revenue sharing program whereby CGMI received from advisers and distributors associated with certain mutual fund complexes revenue sharing payments in exchange for which CGMI granted mutual funds access to, or increased visibility in, CGMI retail distribution network. Second, CGMI failed to disclose adequately at the point of sale, in connection with recommendations to customers to buy Class B shares, that such shares were subject to higher annual fees and that those fees could have a negative impact on the customers' investment returns depending on amount invested and the intended holding period. The Order censured CGMI, required that CGMI cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-10, and required that CGMI pay a $20 million civil money penalty.

The SEC Order further finds that SBFM and CGMI made other omissions and misrepresentations to the Boards in connection with the creation, operation, and compensation of the new arrangement.

DBL internally identified and self reported to the FSA issues relating to both transactions. DBL appointed external advisors to undertake a detailed investigation into the transactions, the results of which were provided to the FSA in May 2004. The first transaction involved a book build in Scania AB, B shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 5, in that DBL had purchased high volumes of Scania AB, B shares using external brokers, rather than trading in DBL's own name, thereby increasing and stabilizing the share price. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner. The current status is closed on 4/11/2006. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions. This fine was paid to the FSA on 13 April 2006.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings.

The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on the basis of information communicated by DB London before the issuance of the bonds was publicly announced, during its market sounding activities.  The AMF concluded that DB had no culpability in relation to alleged insider dealing activities, but alleged procedural, record keeping omissions by DB, in relation to the records it maintained of the market soundings.  On December 22, 2006, the AMF notified DB London that it would be sanctioned for technical and procedural violations in connection with a convertible bond offering by Alcatel, DB lead managed the transaction.  There was no case to answer for insider trading. DB London conducted market soundings with several hedge funds ahead of the offering in December 2002. DB London was able to produce documentation sufficient to attest that it was engaged in market sounding which is permitted under AMF Rules. However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations. AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.	AMF imposed a monetary sanction of 300,000 Euros, which has been paid in full.

Public Protection Cabinet of Kentucky ('The Department')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 1/11/2010.  The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. KRS 292.330(13)(A)7 allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. KRS 292.330(13)(A)9A allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on January 11, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $355,386.70 to the Kentucky State Treasurer and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $355,386.70 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $355,386.70 to the Kentucky State Treasurer and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

Johnson	Docket/Case Number: 3-10121	22-DEC-1999	United States Securities and Exchange Commission	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Scudder Investments Service Company, formerly known as Kemper Service Company ('KSvC'); Scudder Distributors, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Distributors Inc. ('KDI'); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

The order finds CGMI willfully violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-10 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

0001018490-11-000002	fsrFalseStatementOrOmission	93	Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	Securities Division No. 2009-0311	22-SEP-2010	Division of Securities of Office of Attny General of Maryland ('The Division')	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter:  Initiation date 9/22/2010.  The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 11-412(A)(7) of the Maryland Securities Act  allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 11-412(A)(7) of the Maryland Securities Act allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on September 22, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $718,212.94 to the Maryland Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet').  The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $718,212.94 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount.  The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact and consent order, DBSI agreed to pay $718,212.94 to the Maryland Div. of Sec. and take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.
