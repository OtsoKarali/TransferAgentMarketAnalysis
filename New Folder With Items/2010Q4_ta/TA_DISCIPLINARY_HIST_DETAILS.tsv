In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC )the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action).

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

0001455353-10-000008	sraViolationOfRules	1	Frank Edward Brickell	Complaint	31-MAR-2008	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)	FINRA's Department of Enforcement is alleging that activities of three clients of World Trade Financial Corporation violated section 5 of the securities act and Frank Edward Brickell, as the registered representative, violated Conduct Rule 2110 by selling unregistered stock without an applicable exemption from registration. The shares deposited with the registered representative did not contain any restrictions on resale or transfer according to the transfer agent who was in possession of a legal opinion addressing the available of an exemption to registration. Enforcement has argued that the representative and the firm had a heighted responsibility to conduct a further inquiry as to the resale of these shares. The case also involves additional broker dealers, registered representatives, and shareholders who are claimed to have participated in an unregistered distribution. The shareholders and the issuer's officers appear to have knowingly orchestrated a distribution. World Trade Financial Corporation, its supervisors, and the registered representative did not knowingly participate in the alleged distribution. At the commencement of the hearing it was argued that distribution did occur, but there was lack of evidence that an illegal distribution occurred. The underlying premise is whether World Trade Financial Corporation had a heightened responsibility to conduct further inquires concerning the resale of the securities.	The decision is on appeal with the National Adjudicatory Council.

SEC Auction Rate Secruities Action 6.3.09	03-JUN-2009	US District Court, Southern District of New York	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter. Initiation date 06.03.2009. The SECs complaint alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) misled its customers about the nature, liquidity and risks associated with Auction Rate Securities (ARS) that DBSI underwrote, marketed and sold and that DBSI reinforced the perception that ARS were safe and liquid by committing its own capital to support ARS auctions for which it served as the lead manager to ensure that those auctions did not fail. Without admitting or denying the allegations, in the SEC complaint, DBSI consented to the entry of an injunction permanently enjoining it from engaging in violation of Section 15(C) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC has granted waivers, exemptions, and no action relief from the collateral consequences of the injunction in areas under the SECs jurisdiction. In addition to the injunction noted above, the judgment of the District of Court requires DBSI to comply with the undertakings specified in the judgment, and provides that DBSI may be required to pay civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21(D)(3) of the Exchange Act. The undertakings require among other things, that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors, reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par, participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors, work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back, agree not to liquidate its own inventory of a particular ARS without making that liquidity opportunity available, as soon as practicable, for eligible customer, and provide other relief as described in the judgment.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, DBSI consented to the entry of an injunction permanently enjoining it from engaging in violations of Section 15 (C) of the Securities Act of 1934.

(DBSI), a Control Affiliate of the Registrant	File No. 3 12514	19-JAN-2007	United States Securities and  Exchange Commission.	The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Amended filing date: 12/21/2006. On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) in connection with DBSI alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct. On December 21, 2006 the SEC also issued an order under Rule 602(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., Deutsche Investment Management Americas, Inc., and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., granting a waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(C)(3). Without admitting or denying the SEC allegations or findings, DBSI agreed to total payment of $442,954, consisting of $202,835 in disgorgement, $202,835 in civil penalty, and $37,284 in prejudgment interest. The fine of $442,954 was paid on January 19, 2007.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with than investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ('Scudder Kemper'), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Order'), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

DBL internally identified and self reported to the FSA issues relating to both transactions. DBL appointed external advisors to undertake a detailed investigation into the transactions, the results of which were provided to the FSA in May 2004. The first transaction involved a book build in Scania AB, B shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 5, in that DBL had purchased high volumes of Scania AB, B shares using external brokers, rather than trading in DBL's own name, thereby increasing and stabilizing the share price. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner. The current status is closed on 4/11/2006. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions. This fine was paid to the FSA on 13 April 2006. DBL agreed to pay: (i) a fine of GBP 3,500,000, and a 'loss avoidance' figure of GBP 2,363,643 with respect to the Scania transaction due to the DBL purchases and the inaccurate coverage statements (ii) a fine of GBP 500,000 with respect to the Cytos Biotechnology transaction for failure to follow internal procedures on stabilization, and failure to escalate issue to Compliance in a timely manner.	For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions.

CIBC Mellon Trust Company	14-JAN-2005	U.S Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC')	CIBC Mellon Trust Company ('CMTC'), a transfer agent that is an affiliate of Registrant by virtue of Mellon Canada Holding Company's 50 percent interest in the joint venture, submitted a Consent to Entry of Judgment (the 'Consent'), which was presented by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the 'Court') on February 16, 2005. In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on Feb. 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10B(1) and 10C(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent.  See item (v) above for detail.

In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC )the 'Final Judgment') without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued 'legend free' stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the 'Order'). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10(b)(1) and 10(c)(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent. See item (v) above for detail.

Second, CGMI failed to disclose adequately at the point of sale, in connection with recommendations to customers to buy Class B shares, that such shares were subject to higher annual fees and that those fees could have a negative impact on the customers' investment returns depending on amount invested and the intended holding period.

NASD Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent	22-MAR-2005	National Association of Security Dealers - NASD (nka FINRA)	On March 22, 2005 the NASD accepted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent dated March 18, 2005 (the 'AWC') submitted by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ('CGMI'), a control affiliate of Registrant. Without admitting or denying the findings, CGMI accepted and consented, prior to a hearing and without an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of findings by NASD. In particular, NASD found that, in connection with its sale of Class B and Class C mutual fund shares to its customers, CGMI, through its registered representatives, known as financial consultants ('FCs'), either did not adequately disclose at the point of sale, or did not adequately consider in connection with its recommendations to customers to purchase Class B and Class C shares, the differences in share classes and that an equal investment in Class A shares would generally have been more advantageous for the customers. NASD further found that CGMI's supervisory and compliance policies and procedures were not reasonably designed to ensure that FC's consistently provided adequate disclosure or, or consideration to, the benefits of the various share classes as they applied to individual customers. As a result of such conduct, NASD found that CGMI had violated NASD Conduct Rules 2110, 2310, and 3010. Based on its findings and with CGMI's consent, NASD, censured CGMI and fined it $6.25 million. In the AWC, CGMI also agreed to complete certain undertakings, including retaining an Independent Consultant, among other things, to conduct a comprehensive review of the completeness of its disclosures regarding the differences in mutual fund share classes and the policies and procedures relating to CGMI's recommendations to its customers of different class shares of mutual funds.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

Autorite Des Marches Financiers ('AMF') alleged certain abuses arising out of a convertible offer by Vivendi which took place in November 2002.  The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.  The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro  convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known.  The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules.  Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty. The AMF alleged that DBAG London failed to retain proper records of its 'Market Sounding' communications and failed to retain relevant tape recordings. The AMF did not allege that the mistaken erasure of the tapes was intentional.	Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and accepted a fine of E750,000.00.

The SEC's complaint alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') misled its customers about the nature, liquidity and risks associated with Auction Rate Securities ('ARS') that DBSI underwrote, marketed and sold and that DBSI reinforced the perception that ARS were safe and liquid by committing its own capital to support ARS auctions for which it served as the lead manager to ensure that those auctions did not fail.

The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Amended filing date: 12/21/2006. On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ('DBSI') in connection with DBSI's alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C-1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct. On December 21, 2006 the SEC also issued an order under Rule 602(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., Deutsche Investment Management Americas, Inc., and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., granting a waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(C)(3).

The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ('DSAL') on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid.

('DBSI'): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ('ARS'), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 409.4-412(D)(13), RSMO allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 409.4-412(D)(13), RSMO allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees.  Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Division on January 14, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $42,466.97 to the Missouri Securities Division and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008.  The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the 'Term Sheet'). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $42,466.97 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $42,466.97 to the Missouri Securities Division and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/08.

(VK)	Inquiry	14-SEP-2009	Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority (FINRA)	The Financial Industry National Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has made an inquiry into the Van Kampen In Kind Exchange Program offered by some of the Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) whereby, an investor can elect an in kind exchange (IKE) of his pro rata share of securities from a terminating UIT and have the securities directly exchanged and invested into the new UIT, which provides a tax benefit for the shareholder. FINRA inquired into the price at which IKEs were executed, because the prospectus language was unclear whether an IKE would be affected at NAV and not at the cash exchange price (which was NAV minus 1 percent), and that this may have been confusing to certain shareholders. Van Kampen agreed to revise prospectus language prior to June 1, 2010, to clarify the IKE process. Van Kampen agreed to pay restitution to all clients that elected IKEs between September 2006 and May 2010, where the IKE was executed at a less advantageous price to the shareholder than the price for a cash rollover of the same UIT happening on the same day, and where the aggregate price differential of all such transactions during that period a minimum threshold of 10 dollars per shareholder.	VK engaged in settlement negotiations with FINRA with respect to the penalty amount resulting in VK establishing a reserve of $300,000 which any restitution and penalty will be charged.
