A. 20140417491: The findings stated that the Firm failed to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the regulatory risks in connection with its Direct Market Access (DMA) business because the Firm failed to include a customer's DMA trading activity in its post-trade market abuse surveillance between March 1, 2014 and April 30, 2014, and, in doing so, failed to detect potential layering activity by this customer. B. 20140435497: The findings state that the Firm discovered and self-reported to FINRA that due to an error during a change in the Firm's internal systems, certain post-trade market abuse surveillance was not run on the firm's customer equity DMA business when utilizing two separate systems.

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998.

On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with Certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls). DBAG paid a 55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015.

Specifically, the Federal Reserve determined that, as a result of the deficiencies identified in the Order, DBAG had not implemented a compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with Volcker Rule requirements and had engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices and violated provisions of the Volcker Rule. DBAG consented to the entry of the Order on April 20, 2017 by the Federal Reserve, pursuant to which DBAG: (A) was required to pay a civil monetary penalty of $19.71 million, which DBAG paid on April 20, 2017; and (B) submit (1) a written plan to improve senior management's oversight of DBAG's compliance with Volcker Rule requirements and (2) an enhanced written internal controls and compliance risk management program to comply with the Volcker Rule, in each case acceptable to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Order requires DBAG to submit, within 60 days of the date of the Order, (1) a written plan to improve senior management's oversight of DBAG's compliance with Volcker Rule requirements and (2) an enhanced written internal controls and compliance risk management program to comply with the Volcker Rule, in each case acceptable to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. DBAG must fully implement each of the required written plan and written program within six months from the date on which DBAG is notified that the plan or program is acceptable to the Reserve Bank.

On April 20, 2017, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (The ""FED""), DBAG, DB USA Corporation and DBAG's New York Branch (collectively, ""The Bank"") entered into a Consent Order. Although the FED acknowledged that the Bank ""fully cooperated"" with the FED and ""has made and continues to make progress in implementing enhancements to its firm-wide compliance systems and controls"", the FED found that during the review period from October 2008 through October 2013, the Bank lacked adequate governance, risk management, compliance and audit policies and procedures to ensure that the Bank's foreign exchange activities complied with safe and sound banking practices and applicable internal policies, which prevented the Bank from detecting and addressing unsafe and unsound conduct by certain of its FX traders. As a result of this conduct, the FED found that the Bank engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Bank consented to the entry of the Order on April 20, 2017 by the FED, pursuant to which the Bank: (A) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $136,950,000, which the Bank paid on April 20, 2017; and (B) shall submit written plans to improve senior management oversight and the compliance risk management program, an enhanced written internal controls and compliance program, and an enhanced written internal audit program to the FED within 90 days of the Order; (C) shall conduct periodic monitoring by senior management, an annual review of compliance policies and procedures and their implementation and an appropriate risk-focused sampling of other key controls, and a firm-wide risk assessment to evaluate current potential conduct risks; (D) for subsections B&C, shall adopt and promptly implement the approved plans and programs within 10 days of approval by the FED and thereafter fully comply with them; and (E) shall submit quarterly written progress reports to the FED. The Order requires the Bank to implement improvements in its oversight, internal controls, risk management, and audit programs, and to conduct an annual review of compliance policies and procedures and a risk-focused sampling of other key controls. The Bank must submit to the FED written progress reports on a quarterly basis detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the Order and the results thereof.

Specifically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board found that (A) the most recent examination of the BSA/AML program at DBTCA and the New York branch conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified significant deficiencies in DBTCA's and the branch's risk management and compliance with BSA/AML requirements that resulted in a violation of the Regulatory Compliance Program requirement, and (B) deficiencies in DBTCA's transaction monitoring capabilities prevented DBTCA from properly assessing BSA/AML risk for billions of dollars in certain potentially suspicious transactions.

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking & Securities division business, (1)its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers to inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) it AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective systems for monitoring money flows associated with transactions; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant to which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rules into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Laws 44 and 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R.R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C. DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by the DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch: (a) shall pay a civil and monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017; and (b) engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the Order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing BSA/AML compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York Branch recommend corrective actions, and oversee the implementation of corrective actions the DFS deems necessary.

The independent monitor must submit to DBAG a written report on its findings and recommendations. Sixty days thereafter, DBAG must submit to the DFS a written action plan to improve and enhance its BSA/AML compliance programs, after which the DFS will determine which recommendations DBAG should implement. The independent monitor will thereafter oversee the implementation of the recommendations, assess DBAG's compliance with the corrective measures, and submit additional reports or recommendations as necessary.

The activities cited in the consent order are grounds, pursuant to the act, for the initiation of administrative proceedings, and, pursuant to the act, to impose such other remedial measures as may be necessary in the public interest.

The term sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $535,364.03 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedures for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."

The allegations centered on whether hedge funds acted on information offered by DBAG London before the issuance of the bond was publicly announced.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules. Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business.

The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order."

Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R.

In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC.

(""KDI""); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (""Scudder Kemper""), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings."	Without admitting or denying the findings, the Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined it $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	on 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

0001285911-19-000004	violationOfRegulations	8	The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon)	SEC RELEASE NO. 33-10856; ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING FILE NO. 3-18933	17-DEC-2018	"Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"")"	"This action arises out of the SEC's assertion that BNY Mellon, as depositary bank, engaged in improper practices in connection with the pre-release of American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs""). Specifically, the SEC Staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number of foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (i) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNYMellon in which BNYMellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil money penalty of $20.5 million.

In the Consent, and solely for the purpose of the injunctive action and any other proceedings arising out of the SEC's investigation brought by or on behalf of the SEC or to which the SEC is a party, CMTC consented to the entry of Final Judgment as to Defendant CMTC (the Final Judgment) without admitting or denying the matters set forth therein (other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Court and the subject matter of the action). The Final Judgment, entered on February 24, 2005, resolved the allegations that CMTC had failed to register as a transfer agent with the SEC, that it had issued legend free stock certificates of a company whose shares were not registered with the SEC, that one of its managers had accepted payments of stock from that company's officers to issue the certificates, and that it had acted as an unregistered broker or dealer in connection with its stock plan administration business. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. CMTC also agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the Final Judgment on March 2, 2005 (the Order). Pursuant to the Order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures. This matter responds to items 10B(1) and 10(2).	Entry of Judgment on consent. See item (v) above for detail.

The shares deposited with the registered representative did not contain any restrictions on resale or transfer according to the transfer agent who was in possession of a legal opinion addressing the available of an exemption to registration. Enforcement has argued that the representative and the firm had a heighted responsibility to conduct a further inquiry as to the resale of these shares. The case also involves additional broker dealers, registered representatives, and shareholders who are claimed to have participated in an unregistered distribution. The shareholders and the issuer's officers appear to have knowingly orchestrated a distribution. World Trade Financial Corporation, its supervisors, and the registered representative did not knowingly participate in the alleged distribution. At the commencement of the hearing it was argued that distribution did occur, but there was lack of evidence that an illegal distribution occurred. The underlying premise is whether World Trade Financial Corporation had a heightened responsibility to conduct further inquires concerning the resale of the securities.	The decision is final.

Specifically, the SEC staff alleged violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, which prohibits, in the offer or sale of securities, engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. As the SEC Order relates, (1) ADRs are negotiable instruments that trade on a U.S. market that represent an interest in a specified number foreign securities that have been deposited with a depositary bank or with the depositary bank's foreign custodian; (2) ADRs allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without having to purchase shares in the foreign market; (3) in some situations, a person may seek to obtain ADRs through a ""pre-release"" transaction whereby a market participant obtains newly-issued ADRs from the depositary bank (as opposed to purchasing an existing ADR from the market) without having already delivered the corresponding ordinary shares to the custodian; (4) the traditional rationale for pre-release transactions was to address settlement timing disparities that could delay delivery to the foreign custodian of recently purchased ordinary shares; and (5) several instruments (the ""Pre-Release Agreements""), including the agreements with the depositary bank, the ADR itself and pre-release agreements with the involved broker-dealers (""Pre-Release Brokers""), either included or required BNY Mellon to obtain representations from the Pre-Release Brokers stating that for the duration of each pre-release transaction, the Pre-Release Broker or its customer (I) beneficially owned corresponding ordinary shares, (ii) assigned all beneficial right, title, and interest in the shares to the depositary, (iii) would not take any action with respect to such shares that was inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, and (iv) would pay foreign withholding taxes at the rate required for ADR holders and pass through to the depositary any dividends and dividend-related tax credits or refunds. The SEC found that BNY Mellon (1) did not take reasonable steps to determine that the Pre-Release Brokers or their counterparties complied with the obligations set forth in the Pre-Release Agreements and (2) at times, negligently facilitated short selling and enabled the settlement of trades with some ADRs that were not actually backed by the ordinary shares held for the benefit of the depositary in accordance with the requirements of the ADR facility."	On 12/17/18 the SEC entered into an administrative settlement on a neither-admit-nor-deny basis with BNY Mellon in which BNY Mellon agreed to pay $29.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $4.2 million and a civil penalty of $20.5 million.

Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Order""), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

DBSI terminated his employment in April 2010. In the AWC settling this matter, DBSI accepted and consented, without admitting or denying, that the firm's lexicon-based search system for the review of electronic correspondence in the PCS division was inadequate to search for terms indicating that a client advisor might be experiencing personal financial difficulties and/or violating certain applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with those difficulties, and that the firm's supervisory system and written supervisory procedures were inadequate to effectively respond to such ""red flags."" Accordingly, as set forth more fully in the AWC, the firm has undertaken to add terms to its email review lexicon for client advisors, to review electronic communications of client advisors from January 1, 2012 to date using those additional terms, and to review its supervisory procedures for responding to ""red flags"" of potential misconduct by a client advisor relating to such personal financial difficulties. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent (""AWC"") consenting to a censure and fine of $100,000.00. The fine was paid on 8/22/12."

The Bank consented to the entry of the Order on April 20, 2017 by the FED, pursuant to which the Bank: (A) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $136,950,000, which the Bank paid on April 20, 2017; and (B) shall submit written plans to improve senior management oversight and the compliance risk management program, an enhanced written internal controls and compliance program, and an enhanced written internal audit program to the FED within 90 days of the Order; (C) shall conduct periodic monitoring by senior management, an annual review of compliance policies and procedures and their implementation and an appropriate risk-focused sampling of other key controls, and a firm-wide risk assessment to evaluate current potential conduct risks; (D) for subsections B&C, shall adopt and promptly implement the approved plans and programs within 10 days of approval by the FED and thereafter fully comply with them; and (E) shall submit quarterly written progress reports to the FED. The Order requires the Bank to implement improvements in its oversight, internal controls, risk management, and audit programs, and to conduct an annual review of compliance policies and procedures and a risk-focused sampling of other key controls. The Bank must submit to the FED written progress reports on a quarterly basis detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the Order and the results thereof. The Order required the Bank to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $136,950,000, which the Bank paid on April 20, 2017."

A. 20130393135: The findings stated that the Firm failed to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the regulatory risks in connection with market access on December 23, 2014. The findings indicated that the Firm failed to have adequate controls in place to prevent the transmission of erroneous orders, because (i) its limit order controls did not take into consideration wide spreads that are quoted at the market open and are not an accurate representation of the trading price of a security; (ii) its controls failed to prevent the entry of a large pre-open market order that resulted in the execution of orders far away from the normal trading price of the security; and (iii) the Firm used an incorrect process to adjudicate a transaction. Specifically, the findings stated that on December 3, 2013, the Firm sent a clearly erroneous filing to NASDAQ in PTC, Inc. When it entered an order at 9:30:00, which resulted in a 100-share execution at $2.21 when the previous close on that stock was $32.58 and the NASDAQ official opening print at that time, but after the Firm's trade, was $32.43. The findings state further that on December 23, 2014, trades occurred between 9:33:00 and 9:34:00, in which the Firm received an electronic buy order for 50,000 shares at market price, and the Firm's Smart Order Router sent high-priced limit orders to various exchanges.

B. 20140417491: The findings stated that the Firm failed to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the regulatory risks in connection with its Direct Market Access (DMA) business because the firm failed to include a customer's DMA trading activity in its post-trade market abuse surveillance between March 1, 2014 and April 30, 2014, and, in doing so, failed to detect potential layering activity by this customer. C. 20140435497: the findings state that the Firm discovered and self-reported to FINRA that due to an error during a change in the Firm's internal systems, certain post-trade market abuse surveillance was not run on the firm's customer equity DMA business when utilizing two separate systems. The findings indicated that in transitioning to one system (a customer DMA platform with Smart Order Routing), the Firm failed to feed its DMA order data into the surveillance models. With only executed trades considered by the Firm's post-trade surveillance, potential manipulative order activity was not captured as part of the Firm's obligation to monitor for manipulation, fraud, and other illegal activity.

Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades,"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides at the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking & Securities division business, (1)its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers to inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) it AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective systems for monitoring money flows associated with transactions; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant to which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017.

The Commission alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (""DBSI""): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities (""ARS""), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI consented to the Commission making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. 70 P.S. Section 305(A)(IX) allows the Commission, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. 70 P.S. Section 305(A)(VII) allows the Commission, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order entered by the Commission on December 15, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $344,384.49 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the ""Term Sheet""). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $344,384.49 penalty imposed by the Commission is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the order."	Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $344,384.49 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before 2/13/2008.

The SEC has granted waivers, exemptions, and no-action relief from the collateral consequences of the injunction in areas under the SEC's jurisdiction. In addition to the injunction noted above, the judgment of the District Court requires DBSI to comply with the undertakings specified in the judgment, and provides that DBSI may be required to pay civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21(D)(3) of the Exchange Act. The undertakings require, among other things, that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; agree not to liquidate its own inventory of a particular ARS without making that liquidity opportunity available, as soon as practicable, for eligible customers; and provide other relief as described in the judgment."

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Ind. Code section 23-19-4-12(D)(13) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct.

FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13."

Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as ""Mirror Trades"" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence (""CDD"") and Enhanced Due Diligence (""EDD"") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions.

FINRA alleged DBSI exceeded the relevant position limit in three different securities for five different customers (exceeding the relevant position limit in a range of between 7.9 percent and 120 percent) for between one and seven consecutive days during October 2011, January 2014, and November 2014, and January 2015 through February 2015. The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360 (B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period of February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360 (B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014).

See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter.

Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson.

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued ""GAP Risk"" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior (""LLS"") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls).

CFTC alleged that DBAG was aware of problems relating to its cancellation messages since its reporting obligations began on December 31, 2012, but failed to provide timely notice to its SDR and did not diligently investigate, address and remediate the problems until it was notified by the Division of Enforcements Investigation in June 2014.
